		<description><![CDATA[Repurposed drugs have demonstrated in vitro success against high-grade gliomas; however, their clinical success has been limited due to the in vitro model not truly representing the clinical scenario. In this study, we used two distinct patient-derived tumour fragments (tumour core (TC) and tumour margin (TM)) to generate a heterogeneous, clinically relevant in vitro model to assess if a combination of repurposed drugs (irinotecan, pitavastatin, disulfiram, copper gluconate, captopril, celecoxib, itraconazole and ticlopidine), each targeting a different growth promoting pathway, could successfully treat high-grade gliomas. To ensure the clinical relevance of our data, TC and TM samples from 11 different patients were utilized. Our data demonstrate that, at a concentration of 100&amp;micro;m or lower, all drug combinations achieved lower LogIC50 values than temozolomide, with one of the combinations almost eradicating the cancer by achieving cell viabilities below 4% in five of the TM samples 6 days after treatment. Temozolomide was unable to stop tumour growth over the 14-day assay, while combination 1 stopped tumour growth, with combinations 2, 3 and 4 slowing down tumour growth at higher doses. To validate the cytotoxicity data, we used two distinct assays, end point MTT and real-time IncuCyte life analysis, to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the combinations on the TC fragment from patient 3, with the cell viabilities comparable across both assays. The local administration of combinations of repurposed drugs that target different growth promoting pathways of high-grade gliomas have the potential to be translated into the clinic as a novel treatment strategy for high-grade gliomas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To predict the two-year recurrence-free survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we propose a prediction model using radiomic features of the inner and outer regions of the tumor. The intratumoral region and the peritumoral regions from the boundary to 3 cm were used to extract the radiomic features based on the intensity, texture, and shape features. Feature selection was performed to identify significant radiomic features to predict two-year recurrence-free survival, and patient classification was performed into recurrence and non-recurrence groups using SVM and random forest classifiers. The probability of two-year recurrence-free survival was estimated with the Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier curve. In the experiment, CT images of 217 non-small-cell lung cancer patients at stages I-IIIA who underwent surgical resection at the Veterans Health Service Medical Center (VHSMC) were used. Regarding the classification performance on whole tumors, the combined radiomic features for intratumoral and peritumoral regions of 6 mm and 9 mm showed improved performance (AUC 0.66, 0.66) compared to T stage and N stage (AUC 0.60), intratumoral (AUC 0.64) and peritumoral 6 mm and 9 mm classifiers (AUC 0.59, 0.62). In the assessment of the classification performance according to the tumor size, combined regions of 21 mm and 3 mm were significant when predicting outcomes compared to other regions of tumors under 3 cm (AUC 0.70) and 3 cm~5 cm (AUC 0.75), respectively. For tumors larger than 5 cm, the combined 3 mm region was significant in predictions compared to the other features (AUC 0.71). Through this experiment, it was confirmed that peritumoral and combined regions showed higher performance than the intratumoral region for tumors less than 5 cm in size and that intratumoral and combined regions showed more stable performance than the peritumoral region in tumors larger than 5 cm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Objectives: To explore the potential of radiomics on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response after transarterial embolization (TAE). Methods: This retrospective study included cirrhotic patients treated with TAE for unifocal HCC na&amp;iuml;ve to treatments. Each patient underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI. Radiomics analysis was performed by segmenting the lesions on portal venous (PVP), 3-min transitional, and 20-min hepatobiliary (HBP) phases. Clinical data, laboratory variables, and qualitative features based on LI-RADSv2018 were assessed. Reference standard was based on mRECIST response criteria. Two different radiomics models were constructed, a statistical model based on logistic regression with elastic net penalty (model 1) and a computational model based on a hybrid descriptive-inferential feature extraction method (model 2). Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were calculated. Results: The final population included 51 patients with HCC (median size 20 mm). Complete and objective responses were obtained in 14 (27.4%) and 29 (56.9%) patients, respectively. Model 1 showed the highest performance on PVP for predicting objective response with an AUC of 0.733, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 40.0% in the test set. Model 2 demonstrated similar performances on PVP and HBP for predicting objective response, with an AUC of 0.791, sensitivity of 71.3%, specificity of 61.7% on PVP, and AUC of 0.790, sensitivity of 58.8%, and specificity of 90.1% on HBP. Conclusions: Radiomics models based on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI can achieve good performance for predicting response of HCCs treated with TAE.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Background: Although the iatrogenic risk of kidney failure is infrequent with treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the repercussions for the patient could be major. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of kidney events in IBD and to examine the protective effect of kidney function monitoring. Methods: In the French National Health Insurance database, 94,363 patients had a diagnosis of IBD between January 2010 and December 2016. By using a survival model with time-dependent covariates, we analyzed the time from inclusion in this IBD cohort to the first hospitalization for acute kidney impairment (AKI) according to patient characteristics, comorbidities, IBD phenotype and presence of monitoring. Results: A total of 693 patients were hospitalized for AKI, with an incidence of 1.36/1000 person&amp;ndash;years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26&amp;ndash;1.47). The incidence of AKI was lower than those without 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) use. Patients with 5-ASA use rarely had any lack of monitoring as compared with those not under 5-ASA use (3% vs. 17%). On multivariate analysis, lack of monitoring was associated with a substantial risk of AKI (hazard ratio 3.96, 95% CI [3.20&amp;ndash;4.90], p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Increased frequency of monitoring is essential to identify nephropathy at an early stage and avoid the progression to chronic kidney disease.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People who use drugs (PWUDs) are generally considered &amp;ldquo;hard-to-treat&amp;rdquo; patients, due to adherence to HCV antiviral therapy or re-infection concerns. Linkage-to-care still remains a significant gap for HCV elimination, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce time-to-treat and improve treatment adherence, we have developed a patient-tailored model-of-care, decentralized within the addiction center and supervised remotely by hepatologists. From January 2017 to December 2020, patients were enrolled in one addiction care center in Southern Italy, where a complete hepatologic assessment, including blood chemistry, ultrasound, and transient elastography examination, was provided. DAAs treatment has been adapted on clinical features, also performing a daily administration during an outpatient visit, and monitored remotely by specialists via telemedicine interactions. Adherence was evaluated on the accomplishment of therapy or on the percentage of attended visits. From a total of 690 PWUDs, 135 had an active HCV infection and were enrolled in the study. All patients started the treatment within 3 weeks after HCV diagnosis. Six drop-outs were recorded, obtaining a sustained virological response at week 12 (SVR12) in 98.5% of PWUDs. There were only two cases of treatment failure, one of which is re-infection. No differences were found between the SVR12 rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We obtained a high SVR12 rate, providing a comprehensive assessment within the addiction care center, tailoring the drug administration with a hepatologic remote stewardship. Our therapeutic model should improve the time-to-treat and treatment adherence in PWUDs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Intrasaccular flow disrupter devices (ISFD) have opened up new ways to treat intracranial aneurysms but choosing the correct size of ISFD can be challenging. We describe the first use of 3D printing to assist in the choice of ISFD, and we report an illustrative case. We developed a technique that uses preoperative angiography to make a plastic model of the aneurysm. We tested the deployment of different sizes of intrasaccular flow disruptor on the 3D model under fluoroscopy. The best devices were then used as the first-line strategy to treat the patient. The preoperative 3D printing helped in the successful selection of a first-line ISFD, which was not the one recommended by the manufacturer. Three-dimensional printing can provide interesting information regarding the treatment of intracranial aneurysms using ISFD. Further studies are needed to fully assess its benefits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This paper targets a major challenge of how to effectively allocate medical resources in intensive care units (ICUs). We trained multiple regression models using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database recorded in the period between 2001 and 2012. The training and validation dataset included pneumonia, sepsis, congestive heart failure, hypotension, chest pain, coronary artery disease, fever, respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, shortness of breath, seizure and transient ischemic attack, and aortic stenosis patients&amp;rsquo; recorded data. Then we tested the models on the unseen data of patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure or acute coronary syndrome. We included the admission characteristics, clinical prescriptions, physiological measurements, and discharge characteristics of those patients. We assessed the models&amp;rsquo; performance using mean residuals and running times as metrics. We ran multiple experiments to study the data partition&amp;rsquo;s impact on the learning phase. The total running time of our best-evaluated model is 123,450.9 mS. The best model gives an average accuracy of 98%, highlighting the location of discharge, initial diagnosis, location of admission, drug therapy, length of stay and internal transfers as the most influencing patterns to decide a patient&amp;rsquo;s readiness for discharge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Recently, several efforts have been made to develop the deep learning (DL) algorithms for automatic detection and segmentation of brain metastases (BM). In this study, we developed an advanced DL model to BM detection and segmentation, especially for small-volume BM. From the institutional cancer registry, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images of 65 patients and 603 BM were collected to train and evaluate our DL model. Of the 65 patients, 12 patients with 58 BM were assigned to test-set for performance evaluation. Ground-truth for BM was assigned to one radiation oncologist to manually delineate BM and another one to cross-check. Unlike other previous studies, our study dealt with relatively small BM, so the area occupied by the BM in the high-resolution images were small. Our study applied training techniques such as the overlapping patch technique and 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) training to the well-known U-Net architecture to learn better in smaller BM. As a DL architecture, 2D U-Net was utilized by 2.5D training. For better efficacy and accuracy of a two-dimensional U-Net, we applied effective preprocessing include 2.5D overlapping patch technique. The sensitivity and average false positive rate were measured as detection performance, and their values were 97% and 1.25 per patient, respectively. The dice coefficient with dilation and 95% Hausdorff distance were measured as segmentation performance, and their values were 75% and 2.057 mm, respectively. Our DL model can detect and segment BM with small volume with good performance. Our model provides considerable benefit for clinicians with automatic detection and segmentation of BM for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The purpose of this article was to assess the effectiveness of ozone therapy as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in periodontitis patients. Thirty-two patients diagnosed with generalized periodontitis were selected, with a total of 655 teeth examined. Each patient&amp;rsquo;s mouth was divided into four quadrants (the split-mouth model) to be randomly treated with four sessions of gaseous ozone or air. The following clinical variables were recorded: the gingival index, the periodontal clinical attachment loss, the Miller&amp;rsquo;s mobility index and the clinical improvements, as assessed through the visual analog scale (VAS). In addition, the microorganisms were qualitatively compared. After four weeks of treatment, the teeth of the ozone-treated quadrants showed statistically significant reductions in the gingival index and an improvement in the clinical attachment (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The same treatment also significantly improved mobility by between 70% and 86% compared to the control group (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Statistically significant differences were also recorded for the VAS (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the qualitative study of the subgingival flora, significant differences were observed (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The overall results of this trial support the view that ozone treatment is effective and well tolerated in cases of generalized chronic periodontitis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a modern imaging technique that uses X-rays to investigate the structures of the dento-maxillary apparatus and obtain detailed images of those structures. The aim of this study was to determine a functional mathematical model able to evaluate the elastic force intensity on each bracket and tube type element and the ways in which those components act on the orthodontic system being used. To analyze a real orthodontic system, we studied the case of a 13-year-old female patient. To transfer geometric information from tomographic images, we used the InVesalius software. This software can generate three-dimensional reconstructions based on sequences and files in the DICOM format and was purchased from CBCT equipment. We analyzed and processed the geometries of the converted tissues in InVesalius using the Geomagic software. After using the Geomagic software, we exported the resulting model to the SolidWorks software used in computer-aided design. In this software, the model is transformed into a virtual solid. After making the geometric model, we analyzed the model using the Ansys Workbench software, which incorporates finite element analysis techniques. Following the simulations, we obtained result maps, which showed the complete mechanical behavior of the analyzed structures.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MRI is an imaging technology that non-invasively obtains high-quality medical images for diagnosis. However, MRI has the major disadvantage of long scan times which cause patient discomfort and image artifacts. As one of the methods for reducing the long scan time of MRI, the parallel MRI method for reconstructing a high-fidelity MR image from under-sampled multi-coil k-space data is widely used. In this study, we propose a method to reconstruct a high-fidelity MR image from under-sampled multi-coil k-space data using deep-learning. The proposed multi-domain Neumann network with sensitivity maps (MDNNSM) is based on the Neumann network and uses a forward model including coil sensitivity maps for parallel MRI reconstruction. The MDNNSM consists of three main structures: the CNN-based sensitivity reconstruction block estimates coil sensitivity maps from multi-coil under-sampled k-space data; the recursive MR image reconstruction block reconstructs the MR image; and the skip connection accumulates each output and produces the final result. Experiments using the fastMRI T1-weighted brain image dataset were conducted at acceleration factors of 2, 4, and 8. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the proposed MDNNSM method reconstructs MR images more accurately than other methods, including the generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) method and the original Neumann network.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(1) Background: Our goal was to develop a risk prediction model for mortality in patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis (AS). (2) Methods: All patients aged 40&amp;ndash;95 years, with echocardiographic evidence of moderate and severe AS at a single institution, were studied over a median of 2.8 (1.5&amp;ndash;4.8) years, between 2013&amp;ndash;2018. Patient characteristics and mortality were compared using Chi-squares, t-tests, and Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier (KM) curves, as appropriate. The risk calculation for mortality was derived using the Cox proportional hazards model. A risk score was calculated for each parameter, and the total sum of scores predicted the individualized risks of 1-and 5-year mortality. (3) Results: A total of 1991 patients with severe and 2212 with moderate AS were included. Severe AS patients were older, had a lower ejection fraction %, were more likely to be Caucasian, and had lower rates of obesity and smoking, but had higher rates of cardiac comorbidities and AVR (49.3% vs. 2.8%, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The unadjusted overall mortality was 41.7% vs. 41%, p = 0.6530, and was not different using KM curves (log rank, p = 0.0853). The models included only patients with complete follow-up (3966 in the 1-year, and 816 in the 5-year model) and included 13 variables related to patient characteristics, degree of AS, and AVR. The C-statistic was 0.75 and 0.72 for the 1-year and the 5-year models, respectively. (4) Conclusions: Patients with moderate and severe AS experience high morbidity and mortality. The usage of a risk prediction model may provide guidance for clinical decision making in complex patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Peritoneal dissemination of pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. We have reported that intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy using a 64Cu-labeled antibody (64Cu-ipRIT) is a promising adjuvant therapy option to prevent this complication. To achieve personalized 64Cu-ipRIT, we developed a new in vitro tumor cell-binding assay (64Cu-TuBA) system with a panel containing nine candidate 64Cu-labeled antibodies targeting seven antigens (EGFR, HER2, HER3, TfR, EpCAM, LAT1, and CD98), which are reportedly overexpressed in patients with pancreatic cancer. We investigated the feasibility of 64Cu-TuBA to select the highest-binding antibody for individual cancer cell lines and predict the treatment response in vivo for 64Cu-ipRIT. 64Cu-TuBA was performed using six human pancreatic cancer cell lines. For three cell lines, an in vivo treatment study was performed with 64Cu-ipRIT using high-, middle-, or low-binding antibodies in each peritoneal dissemination mouse model. The high-binding antibodies significantly prolonged survival in each mouse model, while low-and middle-binding antibodies were ineffective. There was a correlation between in vitro cell binding and in vivo therapeutic efficacy. Our findings suggest that 64Cu-TuBA can be used for patient selection to enable personalized 64Cu-ipRIT. Tumor cells isolated from surgically resected tumor tissues would be suitable for analysis with the 64Cu-TuBA system in future clinical studies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Factor V deficiency, an ultra-rare congenital coagulopathy, is characterized by bleeding episodes that may be more or less intense as a function of the levels of coagulation factor activity present in plasma. Fresh-frozen plasma, often used to treat patients with factor V deficiency, is a scarcely effective palliative therapy with no specificity to the disease. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, following precise deletion by non-homologous end-joining, has proven to be highly effective for modeling on a HepG2 cell line a mutation similar to the one detected in the factor V-deficient patient analyzed in this study, thus simulating the pathological phenotype. Additional CRISPR/Cas9-driven non-homologous end-joining precision deletion steps allowed correction of 41% of the factor V gene mutated cells, giving rise to a newly developed functional protein. Taking into account the plasma concentrations corresponding to the different levels of severity of factor V deficiency, it may be argued that the correction achieved in this study could, in ideal conditions, be sufficient to turn a severe phenotype into a mild or asymptomatic one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Colorectal cancer represents one of the most important causes worldwide of cancer related morbidity and mortality. One of the complications which can occur during cancer progression, is peritoneal carcinomatosis. In the majority of cases, it is diagnosed in late stages due to the lack of diagnostic tools capable of revealing the early-stage peritoneal burden. Therefore, still associates with poor prognosis and quality of life, despite recent therapeutic advances. The aim of the study was to develop a fuzzy logic approach to assess the probability of peritoneal carcinomatosis presence using routine blood test parameters as input data. The patient data was acquired retrospective from patients diagnosed between 2010&amp;ndash;2021. The developed model focuses on the specific quantitative alteration of these parameters in the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, which is an innovative approach as regards the literature in the field and validates the feasibility of using a fuzzy logic approach in the noninvasive diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clinical research based on data from patient or study data management systems plays an important role in transferring basic findings into the daily practices of physicians. To support study recruitment, diagnostic processes, and risk factor evaluation, search queries for such management systems can be used. Typically, the query syntax as well as the underlying data structure vary greatly between different data management systems. This makes it difficult for domain experts (e.g., clinicians) to build and execute search queries. In this work, the Core Ontology of Phenotypes is used as a general model for phenotypic knowledge. This knowledge is required to create search queries that determine and classify individuals (e.g., patients or study participants) whose morphology, function, behaviour, or biochemical and physiological properties meet specific phenotype classes. A specific model describing a set of particular phenotype classes is called a Phenotype Specification Ontology. Such an ontology can be automatically converted to search queries on data management systems. The methods described have already been used successfully in several projects. Using ontologies to model phenotypic knowledge on patient or study data management systems is a viable approach. It allows clinicians to model from a domain perspective without knowing the actual data structure or query language.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Arterial stenosis is a problem of immediate significance, as cardiovascular disease is the number one leading cause of death worldwide. Generally, the study of stenotic flow assumes a smooth, curved stenosis and artery. However, the real situation is unlikely to present an infinitely smooth-surfaced arterial stenosis. Here, the impact of surface roughness on the flow in an arterial stenosis was studied via a computational fluid dynamics analysis. A patient-specific geometry with a smooth surface was reconstructed, and a partially rough model was built by artificially adding random roughness only on the stenotic region of the smooth model. It was found that the flow was oscillatory downstream of the stenosis in the models. A slightly lower velocity near the wall and more oscillatory flows were observed due to the presence of the roughness in the stenotic region. However, the pressure distributions did not vary significantly between the smooth and rough models. The differences in the wall shear metrics were slight in the stenotic region and became larger in the downstream region of the models.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The gut microbiome has a recognized role in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and associated comorbidities such as Type-2 diabetes and obesity. Stool transplantation has been shown to improve disease by restoring endothelial function and insulin signaling. However, more patient-friendly treatments are required. The present study aimed to test the effect of a defined bacterial consortium of nine gut commensal strains in two in vivo rodent models of Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): a rat model of NASH and portal hypertension (PHT), and the Stelic animal (mouse) model (STAM&amp;trade;). In both studies the consortium was administered orally q.d. after disease induction. In the NASH rats, the consortium was administered for 2 weeks and compared to stool transplant. In the STAM&amp;trade; study administration was performed for 4 weeks, and the effects compared to vehicle or Telmisartan at the stage of NASH/early fibrosis. A second group of animals was followed for another 3 weeks to assess later-stage fibrosis. In the NASH rats, an improvement in PHT and endothelial function was observed. Gut microbial compositional changes also revealed that the consortium achieved a more defined and richer replacement of the gut microbiome than stool transplantation. Moreover, liver transcriptomics suggested a beneficial modulation of pro-fibrogenic pathways. An improvement in liver fibrosis was then confirmed in the STAM&amp;trade; study. In this study, the bacterial consortium improved the NAFLD activity score, consistent with a decrease in steatosis and ballooning. Serum cytokeratin-18 levels were also reduced. Therefore, administration of a specific bacterial consortium of defined composition can ameliorate NASH, PHT, and fibrosis, and delay disease progression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has caused panic and chaos that modern society has never seen before. Despite their paramount importance, the transmission routes of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear and a point of contention between the various sectors. Recent studies strongly suggest that COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in inadequately ventilated environments. The present study investigates the possibility of the aerosol transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates the associated environmental conditions. The main objective of the current work is to accurately predict the time duration of getting an infection while sharing an indoor space with a patient of COVID-19 or similar viruses. We conducted a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor airflow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airflow-induced infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were reported in Guangzhou, China. The Eulerian&amp;ndash;Eulerian flow model coupled with the k-&amp;#400; turbulence approach was employed to resolve complex indoor processes, including human respiration activities, such as breathing, speaking, and sneezing. The predicted results suggest that 10 minutes are enough to become infected with COVID-19 when sharing a Table with coronavirus patients. The results also showed that although changing the ventilation rate will improve the quality of air within closed spaces, it will not be enough to protect a person from COVID-19. This model may be suitable for future engineering analyses aimed at reshaping public spaces and indoor common areas to face the spread of aerosols and droplets that may contain pathogens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reaction-diffusion models have been proposed for decades to capture the growth of gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors. However, ill-posedness of the initialization at diagnosis time and parameter estimation of such models have restrained their clinical use as a personalized predictive tool. In this work, we investigate the ability of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to address commonly encountered pitfalls in the field. Based on 1200 synthetic tumors grown over real brain geometries derived from magnetic resonance (MR) data of six healthy subjects, we demonstrate the ability of DCNNs to reconstruct a whole tumor cell-density distribution from only two imaging contours at a single time point. With an additional imaging contour extracted at a prior time point, we also demonstrate the ability of DCNNs to accurately estimate the individual diffusivity and proliferation parameters of the model. From this knowledge, the spatio-temporal evolution of the tumor cell-density distribution at later time points can ultimately be precisely captured using the model. We finally show the applicability of our approach to MR data of a real glioblastoma patient. This approach may open the perspective of a clinical application of reaction-diffusion growth models for tumor prognosis and treatment planning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The liver is the most frequent organ for metastasis from colorectal cancer, one of the most common tumor types with a poor prognosis. Despite reducing surgical planning time and providing better spatial representation, current methods of 3D modeling of patient-specific liver anatomy are extremely time-consuming. The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model trained on an in-house dataset of 84 MRI volumes to rapidly provide fully automated whole liver and liver lesions segmentation from volumetric MRI series. A cascade approach was utilized to address the problem of class imbalance. The trained model achieved an average Dice score for whole liver segmentation of 0.944 &amp;plusmn; 0.009 and 0.780 &amp;plusmn; 0.119 for liver lesion segmentation. Furthermore, applying this method to a not-annotated dataset creates a complete 3D segmentation in less than 6 s per MRI volume, with a mean segmentation Dice score of 0.994 &amp;plusmn; 0.003 for the liver and 0.709 &amp;plusmn; 0.171 for tumors compared to manual corrections applied after the inference was achieved. Availability and integration of our method in clinical practice may improve diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with colorectal liver metastasis and open new possibilities for research into liver tumors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Data classification is an automatic or semi-automatic process that, utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms, learns the variable and class relationships of a dataset for use a posteriori in situations where the class result is unknown. For many years, work on this topic has been aimed at increasing the hit rates of algorithms. However, when the problem is restricted to applications in healthcare, besides the concern with performance, it is also necessary to design algorithms whose results are understandable by the specialists responsible for making the decisions. Among the problems in the field of medicine, a current focus is related to COVID-19: AI algorithms may contribute to early diagnosis. Among the available COVID-19 data, the blood test is a typical procedure performed when the patient seeks the hospital, and its use in the diagnosis allows reducing the need for other diagnostic tests that can impact the detection time and add to costs. In this work, we propose using self-organizing map (SOM) to discover attributes in blood test examinations that are relevant for COVID-19 diagnosis. We applied SOM and an entropy calculation in the definition of a hierarchical, semi-supervised and explainable model named TESSOM (tree-based entropy-structured self-organizing maps), in which the main feature is enhancing the investigation of groups of cases with high levels of class overlap, as far as the diagnostic outcome is concerned. Framing the TESSOM algorithm in the context of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) makes it possible to explain the results to an expert in a simplified way. It is demonstrated in the paper that the use of the TESSOM algorithm to identify attributes of blood tests can help with the identification of COVID-19 cases. It providing a performance increase in 1.489% in multiple scenarios when analyzing 2207 cases from three hospitals in the state of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. This work is a starting point for researchers to identify relevant attributes of blood tests for COVID-19 and to support the diagnosis of other diseases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Blastocystis is a common human intestinal protozoan parasite. Little is known about its prevalence in echinococcosis. This study tested whether Echinococcus multilocularis infection would increase host susceptibility to Blastocystis. A total of 114 fecal samples (68 hydatid disease patients and 46 healthy people) were collected from Tibetans in the Qinghai province in China. The presence of Blastocystis was identified by sequencing of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. Balb/c mice were co-infected with Blastocystis and E. multilocularis and tested for host susceptibility to Blastocystis. The overall Blastocystis prevalence was 12.3%; 16.2% in the patients and 4.4% in healthy people (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Sequence analysis identified three known Blastocystis genotypes, including ST1, ST2, and ST3, and one unknown genotype. Experimental dual infection significantly reduced mouse survival rate (20%), induced more severe signs, and increased intestinal damages with a higher intestinal colonization level of Blastocystis. The mouse model showed that E. multilocularis infection increases host susceptibility to Blastocystis. Our study shows a significantly higher prevalence of Blastocystis in patients with liver echinococcosis and reveals that non-intestinal E. multilocularis infection increases host susceptibility to the Blastocystis. Our results highlight that E. multilocularis infection is associated with Blastocystis. These findings remind us that more attention should be paid to the gut health of the patients with a helminth infection during clinical patient care.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mitophagy is a selective form of autophagy that removes damaged mitochondria. Increasing evidence indicates that dysregulated mitophagy is implicated in numerous autoimmune diseases, but the role of mitophagy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not yet been reported. The aim of the present study was to determine the roles of mitophagy in patient-derived RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and in the collagen antibody-induced arthritis mouse model. We measured the mitophagy marker PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) in RASFs treated with tumor necrosis factor-&amp;alpha; (TNF-&amp;alpha;) using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Arthritis was induced in PINK1&amp;minus;/&amp;minus; mice by intraperitoneal injection of an anti-type II collagen antibody cocktail and lipopolysaccharide. RA severity was assessed by histopathology. PINK1 expression and damaged mitochondria increased in TNF-&amp;alpha; treated RASFs via increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. PINK1 knockdown RASFs decreased cellular migration and invasion functions. In addition, PINK1&amp;minus;/&amp;minus; mice with arthritis exhibited markedly reduced swelling and inflammation relative to wild-type mice with arthritis. Taken together, these findings suggest that regulation of PINK1 expression in RA could represent a potential therapeutic and diagnostic target for RA.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People in need of care also require support within the framework of structured dental care in their different life situations. Nowadays, deteriorations in oral health tend to be noticed by chance, usually when complaints or pain are present. Information on dental care is also lost when life situations change. An older person may rely on family members having oral health skills. This competence is often not available, and a lot of oral health is lost. When someone, e.g., a dentist, physician, caregiver, or family member notices a dental care gap, a structured transition to ensure oral health should be established. The dental gap can be detected by, e.g., the occurrence of bad breath in a conversation with the relatives, as well as in the absence of previously regular sessions with the dental hygienist. The aim of the article is to present a model for a structured geriatric oral health care transition. Due to non-existing literature on this topic, a literature review was not possible. Therefore, a geriatric oral health care transition model (GOHCT) on the basis of the experiences and opinions of an expert panel was developed. The GOHCT model on the one hand creates the political, economic, and legal conditions for a transition process as a basis in a population-relevant approach within the framework of a transition arena with the representatives of various organizations. On the other hand, the tasks in the patient-centered approach of the transition stakeholders, e.g., patient, dentist, caregivers and relatives, and the transition manager in the transition process and the subsequent quality assurance are shown.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Metastatic lesions compromise the mechanical integrity of vertebrae, increasing the fracture risk. Screw fixation is usually performed to guarantee spinal stability and prevent dramatic fracture events. Accordingly, predicting the overall mechanical response in such conditions is critical to planning and optimizing surgical treatment. This work proposes an image-based finite element computational approach describing the mechanical behavior of a patient-specific instrumented metastatic vertebra by assessing the effect of lesion size, location, type, and shape on the fracture load and fracture patterns under physiological loading conditions. A specific constitutive model for metastasis is integrated to account for the effect of the diseased tissue on the bone material properties. Computational results demonstrate that size, location, and type of metastasis significantly affect the overall vertebral mechanical response and suggest a better way to account for these parameters in estimating the fracture risk. Combining multiple osteolytic lesions to account for the irregular shape of the overall metastatic tissue does not significantly affect the vertebra fracture load. In addition, the combination of loading mode and metastasis type is shown for the first time as a critical modeling parameter in determining fracture risk. The proposed computational approach moves toward defining a clinically integrated tool to improve the management of metastatic vertebrae and quantitatively evaluate fracture risk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Health professionals play an essential role in the protection and promotion of health rights without distinction of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity/race, nationality and migration status, age, functional diversity, or any other individual and/or cultural positions. With the growing diversity of patient populations, health professionals must be able to identify and be responsive to individual and cultural diversity, ensuring equity in access to high-quality individually-centered care. For this, it is fundamental to promote training in cultural competence, understood as responsivity and the ability to work the valorization of multiple and intersectional identities throughout life. The paper aims to describe the experience of the implementation of the program &amp;ldquo;Health in Equality&amp;rdquo;, aimed at training the primary healthcare workforce in Portugal, which was based on Sue and Sue&amp;rsquo;s (2008) three-dimensional model of multicultural skills, which champions cultural best practices in an intersectional perspective. Based on the trainees&amp;rsquo; and trainers&amp;rsquo; evaluation of four completed editions developed online between March and July 2021, this study discusses ways to improve the impact of the training program and amplify the number of leaders and role models for other health care providers towards culturally competent healthcare systems and organizations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Insomnia is prevalent in up to 40% of breast cancer survivors. Few studies have examined pessimism and dietary factors as risk factors for insomnia among breast cancer survivors. We leveraged a cohort of 2944 breast cancer survivors who enrolled in the Women&amp;rsquo;s Healthy Eating and Living study; these survivors provided dietary, insomnia, mental health, demographic, and lifestyle information at baseline and at 1- and 4-year follow-up assessments. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Women&amp;rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI)-Insomnia Rating Scale, and pessimism was assessed using the Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R). Total calorie intake and acid-producing diets were assessed using 24 h dietary recalls. Multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to test the independent and joint effects of psychological and dietary factors on insomnia. In the multivariable model, women in the third tertile of pessimism had greater odds (OR = 1.57 95% CI [1.37&amp;ndash;1.79]) of insomnia when compared to women in the lowest tertile. Total calorie intake and acid-producing diets were each independently and significantly associated with insomnia symptoms. Further, pessimism and calorie intake/acid-producing diets were jointly associated with insomnia. For instance, women with pessimism scores in tertile 3 and total calorie intakes &amp;lt; median reported 2 times the odds (OR = 2.09; 95% CI [1.51&amp;ndash;3.47]) of insomnia compared to women with pessimism score in tertile 1 and calorie intakes &amp;lt; median. Our results highlight the need for patient care regarding mental health, and recommendations of healthy dietary intakes for breast cancer survivors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(1) Background: Huntington&amp;rsquo;s disease (HD) is rare incurable hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the gene coding for the protein huntingtin (HTT). Mutated huntingtin (mHTT) undergoes fragmentation and accumulation, affecting cellular functions and leading to neuronal cell death. Porcine models of HD are used in preclinical testing of currently emerging disease modifying therapies. Such therapies are aimed at reducing mHTT expression, postpone the disease onset, slow down the progression, and point out the need of biomarkers to monitor disease development and therapy efficacy. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly exosomes, gained attention as possible carriers of disease biomarkers. We aimed to characterize HTT and mHTT forms/fragments in blood plasma derived EVs in transgenic (TgHD) and knock-in (KI-HD) porcine models, as well as in HD patients&amp;rsquo; plasma. (2) Methods: Small EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and HTT forms were visualized by western blotting. (3) Results: The full length 360 kDa HTT co-isolated with EVs from both the pig model and HD patient plasma. In addition, a ~70 kDa mutant HTT fragment was specific for TgHD pigs. Elevated total huntingtin levels in EVs from plasma of HD groups compared to controls were observed in both pig models and HD patients, however only in TgHD were they significant (p = 0.02). (4) Conclusions: Our study represents a valuable initial step towards the characterization of EV content in the search for HD biomarkers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This study aimed to evaluate the outcome measures and perceptions of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) after being treated with the Enhanced Transtheoretical Model Intervention (ETMI). In this process evaluation mixed-methods study, 30 patients with CLBP electronically completed self-reported measures (function, pain, and fear-avoidance beliefs) before and after ETMI treatment. Subsequently, each patient participated in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. Quantitative analysis showed significant improvements in function (p &amp;lt; 0.001), pain (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and fear-avoidance beliefs (p &amp;lt; 0.001) after receiving ETMI treatment, with a large effect size (Cohen&amp;rsquo;s d = 1.234). Moreover, the average number of physiotherapy sessions was 2.6 &amp;plusmn; 0.6 for the ETMI intervention, while the annual average number in Maccabi is estimated at 4.1 &amp;plusmn; 1.5. Three main themes emerged from the thematic analysis: (1) communication between the patient and the practitioner; (2) psychosocial treatment elements, and (3) ETMI as a long-term solution for CLBP. The findings of the current study highlight patients&amp;rsquo; perceived need for an open and sincere dialogue and for receiving reassurance and encouragement about their LBP. Notably, they had no problem with the fact that they did not receive passive treatment. Accordingly, together with the significant improvement in post-treatment outcome measures, patients perceived the ETMI method as a practical tool for self-managing their back problems in the long term.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IntroductionInformation and communication technologies (ICTs) are recognized as a critical enablers of integrated primary care to support patients living with multiple chronic conditions. Although ICT-enabled integrated primary care hold promises to support complex patients through team-based and continued care, critical implementation factors regarding what ICTs are available and how they enable the integrated model are yet to be mapped in the literature. This scoping review addresses this current knowledge gap in order to identify opportunities and gaps to help guide future implementation of the ICT-enabled integrated primary care model. Aims Objectives Theory or MethodsObjective: This study systematically scoped the literature on ICT-enabled integrated healthcare delivery models for patients with complex care needs to identify which technologies have been used in integrated primary care settings. Method: The Arksey and O’Malley method was used to guide this scoping review. Four electronic medical databases were accessed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, collecting studies published between January 2000 - December 2020. Identified peer-reviewed articles were screened in two stages: 1) title and abstract screening; and 2) full-text review. Relevant studies were charted and analyzed using the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care and the eHealth enhanced Chronic Care model. Highlights or Results or Key FindingsA total of 46,736 articles were screened at the title and abstract level of which 37 met the eligibility criteria of the review. A large number of the studies originated from North America (62.5%) and used a quantitative method as a study design (51%). 70% of the studies used technology to enable professional and clinical level integration through clinical information sharing among a multidisciplinary team or across multiple organizations. There were fewer studies focused on the organization or system-level integration of care through technologies. A range of technologies was used in these models including web-based platforms, mobile applications, and telemonitoring being the most frequently used.&nbsp; Multiple implementation factors were identified that could enable or hinder the successful implementation of technologies including patient health/digital literacy and training; provider workload, attitudes, and beliefs; usability and interoperability of technologies; and system factors such as incentives, technical and human resource support. ConclusionsTo maximize technological benefits in primary care, the literature suggests system-level support and favourable implementation climate are required.&nbsp; Future research is needed to explore how to integrate technologies at an organization and system level to create a health system that is well-prepared to optimize technologies to support patients. Implications for applicability/transferability sustainability and limitations The study findings benefit system leaders in showing the implementation factors and the types of technologies they need to consider when applying technology to optimize their integrated care models. Due to time constraints, gray literature was excluded in the review which may limit the findings of the study.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IntroductionLearn from patient partners how we developed our roles and contributed recommendations by incorporating a peer-led patient partner working group. We will demonstrate scalability and sustainability of this joint ownership model co-developed and fostered by a healthcare organization and a community of patient partners.Key to success is the creation of a continuous learning environment (the working group) where patient partners share experiences and gain diverse perspectives from one another, thereby strengthening their role and project contributions, while improving overall engagement satisfaction.&nbsp; The projects benefit from the increased depth of contribution and subsequent decisions made.Aims Objectives Theory or MethodsWe will demonstrate how experienced patient partners worked with the Centre for Digital Health Evaluation (CDHE) to co-design a partnership structure that supports the CDHE and creates a learning environment within the patient partner community. The structure is based on the principles of integrated leadership, defined accountabilities and mutually supportive relationships. The patient partner community includes a peer-based working group that supports patient partner capacity and expertise development.&nbsp; Overall, while this approach was developed to nurture trust and support more substantive contributions in increasingly complex projects, it has also increased the meaningfulness of the engagements for the patient partners.Highlights or Results or Key FindingsThe Patient Partner Community (PPC) began with two experienced patient partners working with the CDHE as leads for the engagement co-design.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional patient partners were selected based on project needs.&nbsp; As the PPC grew, a peer-led working group evolved into a collaborative learning community and created deeper connections among members.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this model, the PPC also supports the development of project plans and budgets.&nbsp; This integrated approach moves a traditional Patient Family Advisory Council to a more active engagement model.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PPC gives patient partners the opportunity to develop their knowledge, skills and confidence resulting in a greater depth of contribution within their projects.&nbsp; This model has been in place for over 2 years, covering a range of projects from initial planning and research through to published reports.&nbsp; Patient Partners are experiencing more meaningful engagement because they see their viewsConclusionsWe have experienced the success of the patient partner-led working group model and believe it can be applied to most patient engagement frameworks. This peer-led collaboration creates a continuous learning community that supports ongoing patient partner needs and increases the value they bring to the organization. Implications for applicability/transferability sustainability and limitations Most organizations with patient engagement staff and patient partners could support the introduction of a peer-led working group and the joint ownership model.&nbsp; For sustainability, adjustments to an existing patient engagement framework would need to be made. Trusted relationships are the basis for success.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IntroductionUniversity Health Network (UHN), a health system in Canada’s largest urban centre, launched a new model of care to improve the care experience with a focus on integrating all aspects of care whether in or outside of a hospital. This Program is developed and delivered in partnership with VHA Home Healthcare as lead agency, home care provider, and collaborative partner to improve patient experience and outcomes. The Program launched rapidly with great results serving +13,000 patients. This presentation will share how trust, effective governance and leadership helped navigate challenges and partner with organizations, to transform how patient care is delivered.Aims Objectives Theory or MethodsCo-designed by patients and providers, the integrated care experience is seamless, including health and social supports. The Program addressed common patient and caregiver complaints with one: •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Care team and primary contact•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24/7 support line•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital health record•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated fund The success of this Program is rooted in the philosophy of “One Team” across all sectors from a care delivery and leadership standpoint. This provided the ability to break down barriers and improve communication and collaboration.&nbsp; Key objectives: improve the care experience, clinician satisfaction, quality outcomes and population health, including decreasing length of stay, readmissions and ED visits.Highlights or Results or Key FindingsThe integrated delivery team includes patient/caregiver partners, acute, home &amp;amp; community and primary care, finance and data, and regional government bodies. Patients undergoing surgery and living with chronic complex conditions are in scope.The Program was live within four-months in Thoracic Surgery (June 2019). Established infrastructure and system-wide partnerships accelerated implementation to Chronic Heart Failure (spring 2020), COVID Care (spring 2020), and Vascular Surgery (fall 2020). The program has benefited +13,000 patients and early evaluation results indicate improvements in care experience and health system outcomes: 28% shorter length of stay, 48% lower 90-day ED risk, and 33% lower 90-day readmission risk (for the low needs care paths). The trust built among the “One Team”, and strong governance allowed us to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape and expedite expansion to support vulnerable populations. During the pandemic, care paths were adjusted to ensure care continuity, while delivering improved outcomes and experiences.ConclusionsIn less than two years +13,000 patients have benefited and new pathways continue to rollout. The Program continues to identify opportunities to develop partnerships and support shared decision-making across the health system. Ongoing efforts to evolve include expanding connections with community and social supports continue to be critical to success.Implications for applicability/transferability sustainability and limitations The Program has expanded while navigating challenges posed by a restructuring of health care delivery and the pandemic. Through effective governance, leadership and strong partnerships, the program established a sustainable foundation for rapid growth. This includes breaking new ground in looking at opportunities where regional collaborative efforts may be supported.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IntroductionThe Western Ontario Health Team (WOHT) is a newly formed entity aiming to support the primary and secondary healthcare needs of a population of over 514,000 in London-Middlesex, Canada. Adopting a population health management approach, the WOHT “strives to address health needs at all points along the continuum of health and well-being through participation of, engagement with, and targeted interventions for the population”&nbsp; by building (and implementing) integrated, patient-centred care pathways for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).Aims Objectives Theory or MethodsThe key purpose of developing care pathways is to build the foundations of a population health management strategy. Specific objectives will be guided by a co-design process [refer to Abstract: A Co-Design Approach for System Transformation], and will include building care pathways with a sustained care relationship, informing the development of a shared care record, and laying the infrastructure for patient individualized care plans. The process of developing the care pathways will have a secondary objective of building relationships and partnerships which can support implementation efforts across stakeholders.Highlights or Results or Key FindingsCare pathways leverage Business Process Model and Notation, which is an emerging standard being used in healthcare. The result will be an end-to-end care pathway including identification, prevention, assessment/diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation.&nbsp; Care pathways are being focused on COPD and CHF patients, but will be inclusive of holistic elements of care including screening and managing social determinants of health. Care pathways will also be iteratively co-designed with patients, from their perspectives, so they can both be a part of the design process and use the pathway as a self-management tool. Additional results from this exercise will include:•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A patient-centred pathway including a minimum standard set of activities to inform individualized care plans and patient education/self-management; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A capacity planning resource which can be used to make system decisions on resource allocation and acquisition; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quality improvement tool which can be regularly evaluated to promote standardization, integration, and/or transformation where appropriate.ConclusionsDeveloping care pathways is a foundational step in designing a broader population health management approach, which will include system evaluation and digital health solutions. Both the process and end-product of care pathway development have tangible outcomes which can support system transformation and population health management.Implications for applicability/transferability sustainability and limitations Care pathways are focusing initially on the minimum standard set of activities which should be considered for all patients, which makes them scalable to other jurisdictions regardless of regional variation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IntroductionTransfers between acute facilities and the community (namely long-term care homes) have long suffered from challenges to integrated care, often stemming from the current reliance on paper documentation, follow up phone calls, and discussions with the patient to enable transitions in care. Current processes are inefficient for staff and hinder quality care by increasing the risk of errors and readmissions.PointClickCare, the leading electronic health record (EHR) provider for senior’s care, is working to support this challenge through digital innovation. Their new product, Harmony, creates a two-way, digital integration between a hospital EMR and the EHR in long-term care.Aims Objectives Theory or MethodsThis presentation will provide an overview of Harmony, and its capabilities. It will focus on Harmony’s benefits by highlighting the first implementation of Harmony in Canada, at St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton (SJHH).SJHH implemented Harmony beginning in the Spring of 2020. Their focus was on validating the potential of an acute-LTC integration, using the hospital’s Epic HIS system, and St. Joseph’s Villa, a healthcare system partner LTC home that uses PointClickCare. Key areas of focus for project evaluation included validating the clinician experience, timeliness of information being shared, and ease of access to the information within clinical workflows.Highlights or Results or Key FindingsResults from the project evaluation will be shared, including positive results from clinician surveys and interviews, as well as efficiency and time savings resulting from data integration incorporated into the admission and discharge processes.The presentation will also provide insights on the potential for tools like Harmony to enable integrated care coordination and population health management, which are key enablers of successful models of integrated care. Real-time population health dashboards can support the success of innovative approaches to integrated care, such as the Ontario Health Teams (OHTs) and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the United States.ConclusionsThe ability to digitally integrate acute and long-term care can provide numerous benefits, including workflow efficiencies and improved clinical decision-making across the continuum. It also supports strengthening the relationship between hospitals and community providers, which are foundational to quality care as we begin to apply lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.Implications for applicability/transferability sustainability and limitations Compared to other digital innovations, this innovation has a unique opportunity to scale and spread across Ontario, particularly in support of the new OHT integrated care model. Harmony is also EMR ‘agnostic’ so it can be implemented at both Epic and non-Epic hospitals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The demand for health care has increased with the development of global technology and the rise of public health awareness, and smart service systems have also been introduced to medical care to relieve the pressure on hospital staff. However, the survey found that patients&amp;rsquo; willingness to use smart services at the time of consultation has not improved. The main research purpose of this study was to understand the willingness of patients from various groups to use smart medical service systems and to explore the influencing factors on patients&amp;rsquo; use of smart service systems in hospitals through the technology acceptance model. This study distributed questionnaires in the outpatient area of National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch, and a total of 202 valid questionnaires were obtained. After related research and regression analysis, it was found that patients paid more attention to the benefits and convenience brought by smart services. If patients believed that smart services were trustworthy and beneficial to themselves, their usage intention and attitude would be positive. The results of this study are summarized by the following four points: (1) Designed according to the cultural conditions of different regions; (2) think about design from the patient&amp;rsquo;s perspective; (3) strengthen the explanation and promotion of smart services; and (4) add humanized care and design. This study could be used as a reference for hospitals to improve their service quality and systems in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Background: Up to 20% of women diagnosed with tubo-ovarian carcinoma carry a germline pathogenic variant in a cancer-predisposing gene (e.g., BRCA1/BRCA2). Identifying these variants can help to inform eligibility for therapies, guide surveillance and prevention of new primary cancers, and assess risk to family members. The Gynecologic Oncology-Initiated Genetic Testing Model (GOIGT) was initiated at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) to streamline universal germline genetic testing for this population, while addressing the limited resources in the public healthcare system. This study aimed to evaluate the patient experience of participating in this model. Methods: Study participants were patients diagnosed with high-grade non-mucinous epithelial tubo-ovarian cancer who underwent genetic testing through the GOIGT model between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2020. Eligible participants completed the retrospective questionnaires at least one month after result disclosure. Results: A total of 126 patients were tested through the GOIGT model during the study period, of which 56 were invited to participate. Thirty-four participants returned the study questionnaire. Overall, participants did not report decision regret following the genetic testing and were satisfied with the GOIGT model. Participants reported low levels of uncertainty and distress related to the implications of their test results for themselves and their family members. Conclusions: The results of this study support the continued implementation of mainstreamed genetic testing models for women with high-grade non-mucinous tubo-ovarian cancer. Further studies are required to compare experiences for patients with different genetic test results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[COVID-19 prediction models mostly consist of combined clinical features, laboratory parameters, and, less often, chest X-ray (CXR) findings. Our main goal was to propose a prediction model involving imaging methods, specifically ultrasound. This was a single-center, retrospective cohort observational study of patients admitted to the University Hospital Split from November 2020 to May 2021. Imaging protocols were based on the assessment of 14 lung zones for both lung ultrasound (LUS) and computed tomography (CT), correlated to a CXR score assessing 6 lung zones. Prediction models for the necessity of mechanical ventilation (MV) or a lethal outcome were developed by combining imaging, biometric, and biochemical parameters. A total of 255 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Four independent predictors were added to the regression model for the necessity of MV: LUS score, day of the illness, leukocyte count, and cardiovascular disease (&amp;chi;2 = 29.16, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The model accurately classified 89.9% of cases. For the lethal outcome, only two independent predictors contributed to the regression model: LUS score and patient&amp;rsquo;s age (&amp;chi;2 = 48.56, p &amp;lt; 0.001, 93.2% correctly classified). The predictive model identified four key parameters at patient admission which could predict an adverse outcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Malaria is a severe parasite infectious disease with high fatality. As one of the approved treatments of this disease, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) lacks clinical administration guidelines for patients with special health conditions and co-morbidities. This may result in improper dosing for different populations and lead them to suffer from severe side effects. One of the most important toxicities of HCQ overdose is cardiotoxicity. In this study, we built and validated a physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) model for HCQ. With the full-PBPK model, we predicted the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for malaria patients without other co-morbidities under the HCQ dosing regimen suggested by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. The PK profiles for different special populations were also predicted and compared to the normal population. Moreover, we proposed a series of adjusted dosing regimens for different populations with special health conditions and predicted the concentration-time (C-T) curve of the drug plasma concentration in these populations which include the pregnant population, elderly population, RA patients, and renal impairment populations. The recommended special population-dependent dosage regimens can maintain the similar drug levels observed in the virtual healthy population under the original dosing regimen provided by FDA. Last, we developed mathematic formulas for predicting dosage based on a patient&amp;rsquo;s body measurements and two indexes of renal function (glomerular filtration rate and serum creatine level) for the pediatric and morbidly obese populations. Those formulas can facilitate personalized treatment of this disease. We hope to provide some advice to clinical practice when taking HCQ as a treatment for malaria patients with special health conditions or co-morbidities so that they will not suffer from severe side effects due to higher drug plasma concentration, especially cardiotoxicity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Known genetic variation, in conjunction with post-PCR melting curve analysis, can be leveraged to provide increased taxonomic detail for pathogen identification in commercial molecular diagnostic tests. Increased taxonomic detail may be used by clinicians and public health decision-makers to observe circulation patterns, monitor for outbreaks, and inform testing practices. We propose a method for expanding the taxonomic resolution of PCR diagnostic systems by incorporating a priori knowledge of assay design and sequence information into a genotyping classification model. For multiplexed PCR systems, this framework is generalized to incorporate information from multiple assays to increase classification accuracy. An illustrative hierarchical classification model for human adenovirus (HAdV) species was developed and demonstrated ~95% cross-validated accuracy on a labeled dataset. The model was then applied to a near-real-time surveillance dataset in which deidentified adenovirus detected patient test data from 2018 through 2021 were classified into one of six adenovirus species. These results show a marked change in both the predicted prevalence for HAdV and the species makeup with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. HAdV-B decreased from a pre-pandemic predicted prevalence of up to 40% to less than 5% in 2021, while HAdV-A and HAdV-F species both increased in predicted prevalence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a procedure used to treat kidney stones. In PCNL, a needle punctures the kidney through an incision in a patient&amp;rsquo;s back and thin tools are threaded through the incision to gain access to kidney stones for removal. Despite being one of the main endoscopic procedures for managing kidney stones, PCNL remains a difficult procedure to learn with a long and steep learning curve. Virtual reality simulation with haptic feedback is emerging as a new method for PCNL training. It offers benefits for both novices and experienced surgeons. In the first case, novices can practice and gain kidney access in a variety of simulation scenarios without offering any risk to patients. In the second case, surgeons can use the simulator for preoperative surgical rehearsal. This paper proposes the first preliminary study of PCNL surgical rehearsal using the Marion Surgical PCNL simulator. Preoperative CT scans of a patient scheduled to undergo PCNL are used in the simulator to create a 3D model of the renal system. An experienced surgeon then planned and practiced the procedure in the simulator before performing the surgery in the operating room. This is the first study involving survival rehearsal using a combination of VR and haptic feedback in PCNL before surgery. Preliminary results confirm that surgical rehearsal using a combination of virtual reality and haptic feedback strongly affects decision making during the procedure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be a useful treatment option for various mental health disorders. Modern advances in information technology and mobile communication enable delivery of state-of-the-art CBT programs via smartphones, either as stand-alone or as an adjunct treatment augmenting traditional sessions with a therapist. Experimental CBTs require careful assessment in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Methods: We investigate some statistical issues for an RCT comparing efficacy of an experimental CBT intervention for a mental health disorder against the control. Assuming a linear model for the clinical outcome and patient engagement as an influential covariate, we investigate two common statistical approaches to inference&amp;mdash;analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a two-sample t-test. We also study sample size requirements for the described experimental setting. Results: Both ANCOVA and a two-sample t-test are appropriate for the inference on treatment difference at the average observed level of engagement. However, ANCOVA produces estimates with lower variance and may be more powerful. Furthermore, unlike the t-test, ANCOVA allows one to perform treatment comparison at the levels of engagement other than the average level observed in the study. Larger sample sizes may be required to ensure experiments are sufficiently powered if one is interested in comparing treatment effects for different levels of engagement. Conclusions: ANCOVA with proper adjustment for engagement should be used for the for the described experimental setting. Uncertainty on engagement patterns should be taken into account at the study design stage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Coronavirus (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented global crisis because of its detrimental effect on the global economy and health. COVID-19 cases have been rapidly increasing, with no sign of stopping. As a result, test kits and accurate detection models are in short supply. Early identification of COVID-19 patients will help decrease the infection rate. Thus, developing an automatic algorithm that enables the early detection of COVID-19 is essential. Moreover, patient data are sensitive, and they must be protected to prevent malicious attackers from revealing information through model updates and reconstruction. In this study, we presented a higher privacy-preserving federated learning system for COVID-19 detection without sharing data among data owners. First, we constructed a federated learning system using chest X-ray images and symptom information. The purpose is to develop a decentralized model across multiple hospitals without sharing data. We found that adding the spatial pyramid pooling to a 2D convolutional neural network improves the accuracy of chest X-ray images. Second, we explored that the accuracy of federated learning for COVID-19 identification reduces significantly for non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. We then proposed a strategy to improve the model&amp;rsquo;s accuracy on Non-IID data by increasing the total number of clients, parallelism (client-fraction), and computation per client. Finally, for our federated learning model, we applied a differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) to improve the privacy of patient data. We also proposed a strategy to maintain the robustness of federated learning to ensure the security and accuracy of the model.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A fast melt tablet (FMT) is well regarded as an alternative delivery system that might help resolve a patient&amp;rsquo;s non-compliance issue. The main objective of this study was to develop a cocoa butter-based FMT. Additives, namely 5&amp;ndash;15% of PEG 6000, beeswax, paraffin wax, and corn starch, were incorporated into the cocoa butter-based FMT to study the effects of these additives with the physical characteristic of a cocoa butter FMT. An optimum-based formulation was chosen according to the desired hardness and disintegration time and the taste masking property achieved with the model drug&amp;mdash;dapoxetine. The analysis demonstrated that incorporating beeswax (15%) and paraffin wax (15%) could prolong the disintegration time by at least two-fold. On the contrary, the presence of corn starch was found to cause an increase in the hardness and reduction of the disintegration time. The disintegration mechanism might be presumed due to the synergistic effect of starch swelling and cocoa butter melting. The hardness value and in vitro disintegration time of the optimum formulation were recorded at 2.93 &amp;plusmn; 0.22 kg and 151.67 &amp;plusmn; 6.98 s. In terms of dissolution, 80% of dapoxetine was released within 30 min and the dissolution profile was comparable to the innovator product. The formulation was palatable and stable for at least 1 year. The exposure of the FMT formulation at 30 &amp;deg;C for 12 months was reported to be stable. Along with the sound palatability profile and high drug load capacity, the current formulation possesses the desired characteristics to be scaled up and marketed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are typically treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and imatinib is the most commonly used standard of care in first line treatments. The use of this and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated with objective tumor responses and prolongation of progression-free and overall survival, but the treatment of metastatic disease is non-curative due to the selection or acquisition of secondary mutations and the activation of alternative kinase signaling pathways, leading to resistance and disease progression after an initial response. The present preclinical study evaluated the potential use of the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors infigratinib and dovitinib alone or in combination with the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor binimetinib in mouse models of GIST with different sensitivity or resistance to imatinib. Patient- and cell-line-derived GIST xenografts were established by bilateral, subcutaneous transplantation of human GIST tissue in female adult nu/nu NMRI mice. The mice were treated with dovitinib, infigratinib, or binimetinib, either alone or in combination with imatinib. The safety of treated animals was assessed by well-being inspection and body weight measurement. Antitumor effects were assessed by caliper-based tumor measurement. H&amp;amp;E staining and immunohistochemistry were used for assessing anti-mitotic and pro-apoptotic activity of the experimental treatments. Western blotting was used for assessing effects of the agents on kinase signaling pathways. Anti-angiogenic activity was assessed by measuring tumor vessel density. Dovitinib was found to have antitumor efficacy in GIST xenografts characterized by different imatinib resistance patterns. Dovitinib had better efficacy than imatinib (both at standard and increased dose) and was found to be well tolerated. Dovitinib had better efficacy in a KIT exon 9 mutant model, highlighting a role of patient selection in clinical GIST trials with the agent. In a model with KIT exon 11 and 17 mutations, dovitinib induced tumor necrosis, most likely due to anti-angiogenic effects. Additive effects combining dovitinib with binimetinib were limited.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The issue of choosing the method for optimal surgical treatment of a broken fibula has been debatable for many years. At the same time, concomitant repair of tibiofibular syndesmosis injuries does not have a unified approach. It has been determined that osteosynthesis of broken shin bones with syndesmosis injury should combine stable fixation of the broken bone and should not limit the elastic properties of the syndesmosis. In case of a broken fibula, it is recommended to use a stable extracortical fixator and an elastic connection of the syndesmosis injury using a tightrope. An analytical model of the broken fibula, which is blocked with an extracortical fixator metal plate and elastically fixed with a tightrope, has been developed. The research object is the stress&amp;ndash;strain state of the &amp;ldquo;broken fibula&amp;ndash;extracortical titanium plate&amp;rdquo; composition under the action of tightrope tightening fixation. The main research result is an analytical dependence, which makes it possible to determine the permissible value of the tightrope tightening force for elastic fixation of the tibiofibular syndesmosis. The research results have been tested numerically, and the influence of the parameters of plate, bone and damage localization on the permissible value of the tightrope tightening force has been analyzed. By using the rational tightrope tightening force with stable&amp;ndash;elastic fixation of the broken shin, it is possible to reduce the time before the start of loading on the injured extremity and accelerate the functional recovery of the patient.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children seem to be less affected than adults, but data regarding epidemiologic characteristics and biochemical values are poor and essentially based on limited case series. The aim of our study is to highlight the predictive value of some biochemical markers at hospitalization, for the correct classification of the patient in the form of disease. Methods: We performed an analytical retrospective study on 82 pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the emergency department, with moderate or severe form of disease, and treated in our tertiary hospital. We analyzed the epidemiologic characteristics, symptomatology and biochemical values and compare the data according to the form of disease. Results: The mean age at admission was 4.5 years (median 1 year) and the masculine/feminine ratio was 1.5. Comparing the data between the two groups of patients (42 severe/40 moderate), we observed that the severe form presented with a lower pH at admission (p = 0.02), hyperglycemia (p = 0.01), increased values of transaminases (p = 0.01 and 0.02) and hypoproteinemia (p = 0.01). Also, the severe form was statistically significantly associated with comorbidities, acute respiratory distress, rising of the inflammatory markers during hospitalization. Hyperlactatemia (Lactate &amp;gt; 1.5 mmol/L) was significantly associated with the age under one year (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Mortality rate was 9.75% and the median age at death was 3 months. Univariate logistic regression model shows that the presence of anemia increased the probability of death 88 times, comorbidities 23.3 times and ketoacidosis 16.4 times. Conclusions: Metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, hyperglycemia, modified hepatic values and hypoproteinemia are biochemical markers associated with the severe form of disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Presence of anemia, comorbidities and ketoacidosis are important risk factors for death of pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When planning an operation, surgeons usually rely on traditional 2D imaging. Moreover, colon neoplastic lesions are not always easy to locate macroscopically, even during surgery. A 3D virtual model may allow surgeons to localize lesions with more precision and to better visualize the anatomy. In this study, we primary analyzed and discussed the clinical impact of using such 3D models in colorectal surgery. This is a monocentric prospective observational pilot study that includes 14 consecutive patients who presented colorectal lesions with indication for surgical therapy. A staging computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a colonoscopy were performed on each patient. The information gained from them was provided to obtain a 3D rendering. The 2D images were shown to the surgeon performing the operation, while the 3D reconstructions were shown to a second surgeon. Both of them had to locate the lesion and describe which procedure they would have performed; we then compared their answers with one another and with the intraoperative and histopathological findings. The lesion localizations based on the 3D models were accurate in 100% of cases, in contrast to conventional 2D CT scans, which could not detect the lesion in two patients (in these cases, lesion localization was based on colonoscopy). The 3D model reconstruction allowed an excellent concordance correlation between the estimated and the actual location of the lesion, allowing the surgeon to correctly plan the procedure with excellent results. Larger clinical studies are certainly required.]]></description>

This study describes the SPUR questionnaire&amp;amp;rsquo;s finalization and psychometric evaluation.Patients and Methods: Data were collected through an online survey among patients with type 2 diabetes included by general practitioners and diabetologists in France. The survey included four questionnaires, SPUR and three validated adherence measures: BMQ, MARS and ACCEPT. Item-level analysis and a partial credit model (PCM) were performed to refine the response option coding of SPUR items. The final item selection of SPUR was defined using a PCM and a principal component analysis (PCA). Construct validity, concurrent validity and known-groups validity were assessed on the final SPUR questionnaire.Results: A total of 245 patients (55% men, mean age of 63 years) completed the survey remotely and were included in this analysis. Refining response option coding allowed a better discrimination of patients on the latent trait. After item selection, a short, an intermediate, and a long form composed the final SPUR questionnaire. The short form will be used to screen patients for risk and then the other forms will allow the collection of further information to refine the risk assessment and decide the best levers for action. Results obtained were supportive of the construct validity of the forms. Their concurrent validity was demonstrated: moderate to high significant correlations were obtained with BMQ, MARS and ACCEPT scores. Their known-groups validity were shown with a logical pattern of higher scores obtained for patients considered non-adherent and significant differences between the scores obtained for patients considered adherent versus non-adherent.Conclusion: SPUR is a valid tool to evaluate the risk of non-adherence of patients, allowing effective intervention by providing insights into the respective individual reasons for lack of adherence.Keywords: digital questionnaire, non-adherence drivers, psychometric validation, Rasch modelling]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of liver-directed concurrent chemoradiotherapy (LD-CCRT) compared with sorafenib in patients with liver-confined locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). This single institute retrospective cohort study included patients treated with sorafenib or LD-CCRT between 2005 and 2016. Patients with extrahepatic disease and those without PVTT were excluded, leaving 28 and 448 patients in the sorafenib and LD-CCRT groups, respectively. Propensity score matching was performed to balance the differences in clinical features between the two groups. At baseline, the sorafenib group presented higher incidences of unfavorable clinical features, including type III-IV PVTT (53.6% vs. 30.6%, p = 0.048) and bilateral disease extent (64.3% vs. 31.5%, p = 0.001), than the LD-CCRT group. A total of 27 patients from the sorafenib group and 52 patients from the LD-CCRT group were matched. At a median follow-up of 73 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 4.3 and 9.8 months in the sorafenib and LD-CCRT groups, respectively (p = 0.002). Patients with PVTT type II and higher benefited more from LD-CCRT in terms of OS. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that LD-CCRT was a significant prognostic factor for OS. One patient from the sorafenib group and seven patients from the LD-CCRT group underwent curative surgical treatment. Patients who underwent surgical treatment had significantly longer OS. In conclusion, LD-CCRT showed superior survival outcomes to sorafenib in HCC patients with PVTT. LD-CCRT needs further consideration for its substantial local tumor control that can enable curative surgical treatment in selected patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Osteoarthritis is a common musculoskeletal disorder. Classification models can discriminate an osteoarthritic gait pattern from that of control subjects. However, whether the output of learned models (probability of belonging to a class) is usable for monitoring a person&amp;rsquo;s functional recovery status post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is largely unexplored. The research question is two-fold: (I) Can a learned classification model&amp;rsquo;s output be used to monitor a person&amp;rsquo;s recovery status post-TKA? (II) Is the output related to patient-reported functioning? We constructed a logistic regression model based on (1) pre-operative IMU-data of level walking, ascending, and descending stairs and (2) 6-week post-operative data of walking, ascending-, and descending stairs. Trained models were deployed on subjects at three, six, and 12 months post-TKA. Patient-reported functioning was assessed by the KOOS-ADL section. We found that the model trained on 6-weeks post-TKA walking data showed a decrease in the probability of belonging to the TKA class over time, with moderate to strong correlations between the model&amp;rsquo;s output and patient-reported functioning. Thus, the LR-model&amp;rsquo;s output can be used as a screening tool to follow-up a person&amp;rsquo;s recovery status post-TKA. Person-specific relationships between the probabilities and patient-reported functioning show that the recovery process varies, favouring individual approaches in rehabilitation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alcohol-related liver disease is a public health care burden globally. Only 10&amp;ndash;20% of patients with alcohol use disorder have progressive liver disease. This study aimed to identify lipid biomarkers for the early identification of progressive alcohol-related liver disease, which is a key step for early intervention. We performed untargeted lipidomics analysis in serum and fecal samples for a cohort of 49 subjects, including 17 non-alcoholic controls, 16 patients with non-progressive alcohol-related liver disease, and 16 patients with progressive alcohol-related liver disease. The serum and fecal lipidome profiles in the two patient groups were different from that in the controls. Nine lipid biomarkers were identified that were significantly different between patients with progressive liver disease and patients with non-progressive liver disease in both serum and fecal samples. We further built a random forest model to predict progressive alcohol-related liver disease using nine lipid biomarkers. Fecal lipids performed better (Area Under the Curve, AUC = 0.90) than serum lipids (AUC = 0.79). The lipid biomarkers identified are promising candidates for the early identification of progressive alcohol-related liver disease.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rapidly rising medical expenses can be controlled by a well-designed medical insurance payment system with the ability to ensure the stability and development of medical insurance funds. At present, China is in the stage of exploring the reform of the medical insurance payment system. One of the significant tasks is to establish an appropriate reimbursement model for disease treatment expenses, so as to meet the needs of patients for medical services. In this paper, we propose a case-mixed decision tree method that considers the homogeneity within the same case subgroup as well as the heterogeneity between different case subgroups. The optimal case mix is determined by maximizing the inter-group difference and minimizing the intra-group difference. In order to handle the instability of the tree-based method with a small amount of data, we propose a multi-model ensemble decision tree method. This method first extracts and merges the inherent rules of the data by the stacking-based ensemble learning method, then generates a new sample set by aggregating the original data with the additional samples obtained by applying these rules, and finally trains the case-mix decision tree with the augmented dataset. The proposed method ensures the interpretability of the grouping rules and the stability of the grouping at the same time. The experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that our case-mix method can provide reasonable medical insurance payment standards and the appropriate medical insurance compensation payment for different patient groups.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vibrational spectroscopy can detect characteristic biomolecular signatures and thus has the potential to support diagnostics. Fabry disease (FD) is a lipid disorder disease that leads to accumulations of globotriaosylceramide in different organs, including the heart, which is particularly critical for the patient&amp;rsquo;s prognosis. Effective treatment options are available if initiated at early disease stages, but many patients are late- or under-diagnosed. Since Coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) imaging has a high sensitivity for lipid/protein shifts, we applied CARS as a diagnostic tool to assess cardiac FD manifestation in an FD mouse model. CARS measurements combined with multivariate data analysis, including image preprocessing followed by image clustering and data-driven modeling, allowed for differentiation between FD and control groups. Indeed, CARS identified shifts of lipid/protein content between the two groups in cardiac tissue visually and by subsequent automated bioinformatic discrimination with a mean sensitivity of 90&amp;ndash;96%. Of note, this genotype differentiation was successful at a very early time point during disease development when only kidneys are visibly affected by globotriaosylceramide depositions. Altogether, the sensitivity of CARS combined with multivariate analysis allows reliable diagnostic support of early FD organ manifestation and may thus improve diagnosis, prognosis, and possibly therapeutic monitoring of FD.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Laryngeal carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the upper respiratory tract. Total laryngectomy provides complete and permanent detachment of the upper and lower airways that causes the loss of voice, leading to a patient&amp;rsquo;s inability to verbally communicate in the postoperative period. This paper aims to exploit modern areas of deep learning research to objectively classify, extract and measure the substitution voicing after laryngeal oncosurgery from the audio signal. We propose using well-known convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied for image classification for the analysis of voice audio signal. Our approach takes an input of Mel-frequency spectrogram (MFCC) as an input of deep neural network architecture. A database of digital speech recordings of 367 male subjects (279 normal speech samples and 88 pathological speech samples) was used. Our approach has shown the best true-positive rate of any of the compared state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an overall accuracy of 89.47%.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anesthesia refers to the process of preventing pain and relieving stress on the patient&amp;rsquo;s body during medical operations. Due to its vital importance in health care systems, the automation of anesthesia has gained a lot of interest in the past two decades and, for this purpose, several models of anesthesia are proposed in the literature. In this paper, a Wiener Box-Jenkins model, consisting of linear dynamics followed by a static polynomial nonlinearity and additive colored noise, is used to model anesthesia. A set of input&amp;ndash;output data is generated using closed-loop simulations of the Pharmacokinetic&amp;ndash;Pharmacodynamic nonlinear (PK/PD) model relating the drug infusion rates, in [&amp;mu;gkg&amp;minus;1min&amp;minus;1], to the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA), in [%]. The model parameters are then estimated offline using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. Several Monte Carlo simulations and validation tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the identified model. The simulation showed very promising results with a quick convergence in less than 10 iterations, with a percentage error less than 1.5%.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Patient-derived tumoroid (PDT) has been developed and used for anti-drug screening in the last decade. As compared to other existing drug screening models, a PDT-based in vitro 3D cell culture model could preserve the histological and mutational characteristics of their corresponding tumors and mimic the tumor microenvironment. However, few studies have been carried out to improve the microvascular network connecting the PDT and its surrounding microenvironment, knowing that poor tumor-selective drug transport and delivery is one of the major reasons for both the failure of anti-cancer drug screens and resistance in clinical treatment. In this study, we formed vascularized PDTs in six days using multiple cell types which maintain the histopathological features of the original cancer tissue. Furthermore, our results demonstrated a vascular network connecting PDT and its surrounding microenvironment. This fast and promising PDT model opens new perspectives for personalized medicine: this model could easily be used to test all therapeutic treatments and could be connected with a microfluidic device for more accurate drug screening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has been reported to be highly immune to and infiltrated by T cells and has angiogenesis features, but the effect of given features on clinical outcomes followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in ccRCC has not been fully characterized. Currently, loss of function mutation in PBRM1, a PBAF-complex gene frequently mutated in ccRCC, is associated with clinical benefit from ICIs, and is considered as a predictive biomarker for response to anti-PD-1 therapy. However, functional mechanisms of PBRM1 mutation regarding immunotherapy responsiveness are still poorly understood. Here, we performed targeted sequencing (n = 60) and whole transcriptomic sequencing (WTS) (n = 61) of patients with metastatic ccRCC treated by ICIs. By integrating WTS data from the CheckMate 025 trial, we obtained WTS data of 177 tumors and finally identified three molecular subtypes that are characterized by distinct molecular phenotypes and frequency of PBRM1 mutations. Patient clustered subtypes 1 and 3 demonstrated worse responses and survival after ICIs treatment, with a low proportion of PBRM1 mutation and angiogenesis-poor, but were immune-rich and cell-cycle enriched. Notably, patients clustered in the subtype 2 showed a better response and survival after ICIs treatment, with enrichment of PBRM1 mutation and metabolic programs and a low exhausted immune phenotype. Further analysis of the subtype 2 population demonstrated that GATM (glycine amidinotransferase), as a novel gene associated with PBRM1 mutation, plays a pivotal role in ccRCC by using a cell culture model, revealing tumor, suppressive-like features in reducing proliferation and migration. In summary, we identified that metastatic ccRCC treated by ICIs have distinct genomic and transcriptomic features that may account for their responsiveness to ICIs. We also revealed that the novel gene GATM can be a potential tumor suppressor and/or can be associated with therapeutic efficacy in metastatic ccRCC treated by ICIs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Precision medicine can be defined as the comparison of a new patient with existing patients that have similar characteristics and can be referred to as patient similarity. Several deep learning models have been used to build and apply patient similarity networks (PSNs). However, the challenges related to data heterogeneity and dimensionality make it difficult to use a single model to reduce data dimensionality and capture the features of diverse data types. In this paper, we propose a multi-model PSN that considers heterogeneous static and dynamic data. The combination of deep learning models and PSN allows ample clinical evidence and information extraction against which similar patients can be compared. We use the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to analyze the contextual data and generate word embedding, where semantic features are captured using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Dynamic data are analyzed using a long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder, which reduces data dimensionality and preserves the temporal features of the data. We propose a data fusion approach combining temporal and clinical narrative data to estimate patient similarity. The experiments we conducted proved that our model provides a higher classification accuracy in determining various patient health outcomes when compared with other traditional classification algorithms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brain tumours are the most common cause of death among children with solid tumours, and high-grade gliomas (HGG) are among the most devastating forms with very poor outcomes. In the search for more effective treatments for paediatric HGG, there is a need for better experimental models. To date, there are no xenograft zebrafish models developed for human paediatric HGG; existing models rely on adult cells. The use of paediatric models is of great importance since it is well known that the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms behind adult and paediatric disease differ greatly. In this study, we present a clinically relevant in vivo model based on paediatric primary glioma stem cell (GSC) cultures, which after orthotopic injection into the zebrafish larvae, can be monitored using confocal imaging over time. We show that cells invade the brain tissue and can be followed up to 8 days post-injection while they establish in the fore/mid brain. This model offers an in vivo system where tumour invasion can be monitored and drug treatments quickly be evaluated. The possibility to monitor patient-specific cells has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of cellular behaviour and personalised treatments in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases affecting the kidneys. A genetically specific mutation model is required to comprehend its pathophysiology and to develop a drug treatment. In this study, we successfully developed human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) named MUi027-A from skin fibroblasts of a patient diagnosed with ADPKD and carrying the PKD1 frameshift mutation (c.7946_7947delCT). MUi027-A cells showed the same genetic fingerprints as the parental cells, including the presence of the PKD1 mutation. MUi027-A hiPSCs displayed embryonic stem cell-like characteristics with the capability of differentiating into the three germ layers. Upon directed differentiation, MUi027-A hiPSCs could be differentiated into tubular organoids with the expression of renal cell markers. Furthermore, we compared the efficiency of cyst formation in two human iPSC lines with different PKD1 mutations. When cyst formation was induced by either forskolin or blebbistatin, MUi027-A hiPSC-derived kidney organoids displayed higher frequencies of cyst formation when compared to organoids generated from an iPSC cell line with non-truncating PKD1 mutation genotype (c.5878C &amp;gt; T), suggesting the presence of physiological differences in the mechanism of cyst formation between different PKD1 mutants. Overall, we generated and characterized a novel human iPSC line with a specific PKD mutation and demonstrated its potential as a disease model to study the pathophysiology of genetic determinants in the development of ADPKD disease.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disease whose diagnosis, unfortunately, lacks an objective diagnostic tool supporting a thorough psychiatric examination of the patient. We took advantage of today&amp;rsquo;s computational abilities, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and modern machine learning methods, such as stacked autoencoders (SAE) and 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN), to teach them to classify 52 patients with schizophrenia and 52 healthy controls. The main aim of this study was to explore whether complex feature extraction methods can help improve the accuracy of deep learning-based classifiers compared to minimally preprocessed data. Our experiments employed three commonly used preprocessing steps to extract three different feature types. They included voxel-based morphometry, deformation-based morphometry, and simple spatial normalization of brain tissue. In addition to classifier models, features and their combination, other model parameters such as network depth, number of neurons, number of convolutional filters, and input data size were also investigated. Autoencoders were trained on feature pools of 1000 and 5000 voxels selected by Mann-Whitney tests, and 3D CNNs were trained on whole images. The most successful model architecture (autoencoders) achieved the highest average accuracy of 69.62% (sensitivity 68.85%, specificity 70.38%). The results of all experiments were statistically compared (the Mann-Whitney test). In conclusion, SAE outperformed 3D CNN, while preprocessing using VBM helped SAE improve the results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bayesian therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) software uses a reported pharmacokinetic (PK) model as prior information. Since its estimation is based on the Bayesian method, the estimation performance of TDM software can be improved using a PK model with characteristics similar to those of a patient. Therefore, we aimed to develop a classifier using machine learning (ML) to select a more suitable vancomycin PK model for TDM in a patient. In our study, nine vancomycin PK studies were selected, and a classifier was created to choose suitable models among them for patients. The classifier was trained using 900,000 virtual patients, and its performance was evaluated using 9000 and 4000 virtual patients for internal and external validation, respectively. The accuracy of the classifier ranged from 20.8% to 71.6% in the simulation scenarios. TDM using the ML classifier showed stable results compared with that using single models without the ML classifier. Based on these results, we have discussed further development of TDM using ML. In conclusion, we developed and evaluated a new method for selecting a PK model for TDM using ML. With more information, such as on additional PK model reporting and ML model improvement, this method can be further enhanced.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The early prediction of epileptic seizures is important to provide appropriate treatment because it can notify clinicians in advance. Various EEG-based machine learning techniques have been used for automatic seizure classification based on subject-specific paradigms. However, because subject-specific models tend to perform poorly on new patient data, a generalized model with a cross-patient paradigm is necessary for building a robust seizure diagnosis system. In this study, we proposed a generalized model that combines one-dimensional convolutional layers (1D CNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) layers, and attention mechanisms to classify preictal and interictal phases. When we trained this model with ten minutes of preictal data, the average accuracy over eight patients was 82.86%, with 80% sensitivity and 85.5% precision, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. In addition, we proposed a novel application of attention mechanisms for channel selection. The personalized model using three channels with the highest attention score from the generalized model performed better than when using the smallest attention score. Based on these results, we proposed a model for generalized seizure predictors and a seizure-monitoring system with a minimized number of EEG channels.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Radiology reports are one of the main forms of communication between radiologists and other clinicians, and contain important information for patient care. In order to use this information for research and automated patient care programs, it is necessary to convert the raw text into structured data suitable for analysis. State-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) domain-specific contextual word embeddings have been shown to achieve impressive accuracy for these tasks in medicine, but have yet to be utilized for section structure segmentation. In this work, we pre-trained a contextual embedding BERT model using breast radiology reports and developed a classifier that incorporated the embedding with auxiliary global textual features in order to perform section segmentation. This model achieved 98% accuracy in segregating free-text reports, sentence by sentence, into sections of information outlined in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon, which is a significant improvement over the classic BERT model without auxiliary information. We then evaluated whether using section segmentation improved the downstream extraction of clinically relevant information such as modality/procedure, previous cancer, menopausal status, purpose of exam, breast density, and breast MRI background parenchymal enhancement. Using the BERT model pre-trained on breast radiology reports, combined with section segmentation, resulted in an overall accuracy of 95.9% in the field extraction tasks. This is a 17% improvement, compared to an overall accuracy of 78.9% for field extraction with models using classic BERT embeddings and not using section segmentation. Our work shows the strength of using BERT in the analysis of radiology reports and the advantages of section segmentation by identifying the key features of patient factors recorded in breast radiology reports.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To improve patient outcomes after trauma, the need to decrypt the post-traumatic immune response has been identified. One prerequisite to drive advancement in understanding that domain is the implementation of surgical biobanks. This paper focuses on the outcomes of patients with one of two diagnoses: post-traumatic arthritis and osteomyelitis. In creating surgical biobanks, currently, many obstacles must be overcome. Roadblocks exist around scoping of data that is to be collected, and the semantic integration of these data. In this paper, the generic component model and the Semantic Web technology stack are used to solve issues related to data integration. The results are twofold: (a) a scoping analysis of data and the ontologies required to harmonize and integrate it, and (b) resolution of common data integration issues in integrating data relevant to trauma surgery.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a critical public health challenge. Although studies have found several prognostic factors for TBI, a useful early predictive tool for mortality has yet to be developed in the triage of the emergency room. This study aimed to use machine learning algorithms of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop predictive models for TBI patients in the emergency room triage. We retrospectively enrolled 18,249 adult TBI patients in the electronic medical records of three hospitals of Chi Mei Medical Group from January 2010 to December 2019, and undertook the 12 potentially predictive feature variables for predicting mortality during hospitalization. Six machine learning algorithms including logistical regression (LR) random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used to build the predictive model. The results showed that all six predictive models had high AUC from 0.851 to 0.925. Among these models, the LR-based model was the best model for mortality risk prediction with the highest AUC of 0.925; thus, we integrated the best model into the existed hospital information system for assisting clinical decision-making. These results revealed that the LR-based model was the best model to predict the mortality risk in patients with TBI in the emergency room. Since the developed prediction system can easily obtain the 12 feature variables during the initial triage, it can provide quick and early mortality prediction to clinicians for guiding deciding further treatment as well as helping explain the patient&amp;rsquo;s condition to family members.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Background: The integrated approach to electrical cardioversion (EC) in atrial fibrillation (AF) is complex; candidates can resolve spontaneously while waiting for EC, and post-cardioversion recurrence is high. Thus, it is especially interesting to avoid the programming of EC in patients who would restore sinus rhythm (SR) spontaneously or present early recurrence. We have analyzed the whole elective EC of the AF process using machine-learning (ML) in order to enable a more realistic and detailed simulation of the patient flow for decision making purposes. Methods: The dataset consisted of electronic health records (EHRs) from 429 consecutive AF patients referred for EC. For analysis of the patient outcome, we considered five pathways according to restoring and maintaining SR: (i) spontaneous SR restoration, (ii) pharmacologic-cardioversion, (iii) direct-current cardioversion, (iv) 6-month AF recurrence, and (v) 6-month rhythm control. We applied ML classifiers for predicting outcomes at each pathway and compared them with the CHA2DS2-VASc and HATCH scores. Results: With the exception of pathway (iii), all ML models achieved improvements in comparison with CHA2DS2-VASc or HATCH scores (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Compared to the most competitive score, the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) was: 0.80 vs. 0.66 for predicting (i); 0.71 vs. 0.55 for (ii); 0.64 vs. 0.52 for (iv); and 0.66 vs. 0.51 for (v). For a threshold considered optimal, the empirical net reclassification index was: +7.8%, +47.2%, +28.2%, and +34.3% in favor of our ML models for predicting outcomes for pathways (i), (ii), (iv), and (v), respectively. As an example tool of generalizability of ML models, we deployed our algorithms in an open-source calculator, where the model would personalize predictions. Conclusions: An ML model improves the accuracy of restoring and maintaining SR predictions over current discriminators. The proposed approach enables a detailed simulation of the patient flow through personalized predictions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The spread dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have not yet been fully understood after two years of the pandemic. The virus&amp;rsquo;s global spread represented a unique scenario for advancing infectious disease research. Consequently, mechanistic epidemiological theories were quickly dismissed, and more attention was paid to other approaches that considered heterogeneity in the spread. One of the most critical advances in aerial pathogens transmission was the global acceptance of the airborne model, where the airway is presented as the epicenter of the spread of the disease. Although the aerodynamics and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the air have been extensively studied, the actual probability of contagion is still unknown. In this work, the individual heterogeneity in the transmission of 22 patients infected with COVID-19 was analyzed by close contact (cough samples) and air (environmental samples). Viral RNA was detected in 2/19 cough samples from patient subgroups, with a mean Ct (Cycle Threshold in Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis) of 25.7 &amp;plusmn; 7.0. Nevertheless, viral RNA was only detected in air samples from 1/8 patients, with an average Ct of 25.0 &amp;plusmn; 4.0. Viral load in cough samples ranged from 7.3 &amp;times; 105 to 8.7 &amp;times; 108 copies/mL among patients, while concentrations between 1.1&amp;ndash;4.8 copies/m3 were found in air, consistent with other reports in the literature. In patients undergoing follow-up, no viral load was found (neither in coughs nor in the air) after the third day of symptoms, which could help define quarantine periods in infected individuals. In addition, it was found that the patient&amp;rsquo;s Ct should not be considered an indicator of infectiousness, since it could not be correlated with the viral load disseminated. The results of this work are in line with proposed hypotheses of superspreaders, which can attribute part of the heterogeneity of the spread to the oversized emission of a small percentage of infected people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are limited patient-reported outcome (PRO) data tracking changes in toxicity in patients actively undergoing radiotherapy. Between 2015&amp;ndash;2019, acute toxicity was prospectively measured in 698 patients undergoing a 5-week course of pelvic radiotherapy for gynecologic cancers using a weekly PRO questionnaire. Our questionnaire was able detect a pattern of onset and resolution of acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity in 27 out of 32 questions. Logistic regression analysis showed that increasing GI and GU toxicity at week 2 could predict for severe toxicity at week 5. However, due to a low number of severe events, univariate results could not be productively added to a multivariate model. We observed a &amp;gt;70% response rate for all sections of the questionnaire, except for questions on sexual and vaginal health, which had a 13% average response rate. By demonstrating that PRO data can be used to track acute toxicity during radiotherapy, there is a need to further examine how this tool may be implemented in the clinic to provide complex, adaptive care, such as early side effect management, and modifying radiation delivery in real-time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Intracranial aneurysms are pouch-like extrusions from the vessels at the base of the brain which can rupture and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The pathophysiological mechanism of aneurysm formation is thought to be a consequence of blood flow (hemodynamic) induced changes on the endothelium. In this study, the results of a personalized aneurysm-on-a-chip model using patient-specific flow parameters and patient-specific cells are presented. CT imaging was used to calculate CFD parameters using an immersed boundary method. A microfluidic device either cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-EC) was used. Both types of endothelial cells were exposed for 24 h to either 0.03 Pa or 1.5 Pa shear stress, corresponding to regions of low shear and high shear in the computational aneurysm model, respectively. As a control, both cell types were also cultured under static conditions for 24 h as a control. Both HUVEC and hiPSC-EC cultures presented as confluent monolayers with no particular cell alignment in static or low shear conditions. Under high shear conditions HUVEC elongated and aligned in the direction of the flow. HiPSC-EC exhibited reduced cell numbers, monolayer gap formation and cells with aberrant, spread-out morphology. Future research should focus on hiPSC-EC stabilization to allow personalized intracranial aneurysm models.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is one of the prevalent forms of neuropathy that involves alterations in biomechanical changes in the human gait. Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is one of the pervasive types of complications that arise due to DN. In the literature, for the last 50 years, researchers have been trying to observe the biomechanical changes due to DN and DFU by studying muscle electromyography (EMG) and ground reaction forces (GRF). However, the literature is contradictory. In such a scenario, we propose using Machine learning techniques to identify DN and DFU patients by using EMG and GRF data. We collected a dataset from the literature which involves three patient groups: Control (n = 6), DN (n = 6), and previous history of DFU (n = 9) and collected three lower limb muscles EMG (tibialis anterior (TA), vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL)), and three GRF components (GRFx, GRFy, and GRFz). Raw EMG and GRF signals were preprocessed, and different feature extraction techniques were applied to extract the best features from the signals. The extracted feature list was ranked using four different feature ranking techniques, and highly correlated features were removed. In this study, we considered different combinations of muscles and GRF components to find the best performing feature list for the identification of DN and DFU. We trained eight different conventional ML models: Discriminant analysis classifier (DAC), Ensemble classification model (ECM), Kernel classification model (KCM), k-nearest neighbor model (KNN), Linear classification model (LCM), Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), Support vector machine classifier (SVM), and Binary decision classification tree (BDC), to find the best-performing algorithm and optimized that model. We trained the optimized the ML algorithm for different combinations of muscles and GRF component features, and the performance matrix was evaluated. Our study found the KNN algorithm performed well in identifying DN and DFU, and we optimized it before training. We found the best accuracy of 96.18% for EMG analysis using the top 22 features from the chi-square feature ranking technique for features from GL and VL muscles combined. In the GRF analysis, the model showed 98.68% accuracy using the top 7 features from the Feature selection using neighborhood component analysis for the feature combinations from the GRFx-GRFz signal. In conclusion, our study has shown a potential solution for ML application in DN and DFU patient identification using EMG and GRF parameters. With careful signal preprocessing with strategic feature extraction from the biomechanical parameters, optimization of the ML model can provide a potential solution in the diagnosis and stratification of DN and DFU patients from the EMG and GRF signals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Purpose: With the rapid development of medical informatization, information overload and asymmetry have become major obstacles that limit patients&amp;rsquo; ability to find appropriate telemedicine specialists. Although doctor recommendation methods have been proposed, they fail to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, and electronic medical records (EMRs), patient preferences, potential interest of service providers and the changes over time are largely under-explored. Therefore, this study develops a self-adaptive telemedicine specialist recommendation method that incorporates specialist activity and patient utility feedback from the perspective of privacy protection to fill the research gaps. Methods: First, text vectorization, view similarity and probabilistic topic model are used to construct the patient and specialist feature models based on patients&amp;rsquo; EMRs and specialists&amp;rsquo; long- and short-term knowledge backgrounds, respectively. Second, the recommended specialist candidate set and recommendation index are obtained based on the similarity between patient features. Then, the specialist long-term knowledge feature model is used to update the newly registered specialist recommendation index and the recommended specialist candidate set to overcome the data sparsity and cold-start issues, and the specialist short-term knowledge feature model is adopted to extend the recommended specialist candidate set at the semantic level. Finally, we introduce the specialists&amp;rsquo; activity and patients&amp;rsquo; perceived utility feedback mechanism to construct a closed-loop adjusted and optimized specialist recommendation method. Results: An empirical study was conducted integrating EMRs of telemedicine patients from the National Telemedicine Center of China and specialists&amp;rsquo; profiles and ratings from an online healthcare platform. The proposed method successfully recommended relevant and active telemedicine specialists to the target patient, and increased the recommended opportunities for newly registered specialists to some extent. Conclusions: The proposed method emphasizes the adaptability and acceptability of the recommended results while ensuring their accuracy and relevance. Specialists&amp;rsquo; activity and patients&amp;rsquo; perceived utility jointly contribute to the acceptability of recommended results, and the recommendation strategy achieves the organic fusion of the two. Several comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and operability of the hybrid recommendation strategy under the premise of data sparsity and privacy protection, enabling effective matching of patients&amp;rsquo; demand and service providers&amp;rsquo; capabilities, and providing beneficial insights for data-driven telemedicine services.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fate of pharmaceuticals in the human body, from their absorption to excretion is well studied. However, medication often leaves the patient&amp;rsquo;s body in an unchanged or metabolised, yet still active, form. Diazepam and its metabolites, ranging up to 100 &amp;micro;g/L, have been detected in surface waters worldwide; therefore, the question of its influence on model aquatic plants, such as duckweed (Lemna minor), needs to be addressed. Lemna was cultivated in a Steinberg medium containing diazepam in three concentrations&amp;mdash;0.2, 20, and 2000 &amp;micro;g/L. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), leaf count, mass, and the fluorescence quantum yield of photosynthesis were assessed. The medium was also analysed by LC-MS/MS to determine the concentration of diazepam metabolites. Our results show no negative impact of diazepam on Lemna minor, even in concentrations significantly higher than those that are ecotoxicologically relevant. On the contrary, the influence of diazepam on Lemna suggests growth stimulation and a similarity to the effect diazepam has on the human body. The comparison to the human body may be accurate because &amp;gamma;-Aminobutyric acid-like (GABA-like) receptors responsible for the effect in humans have also been recently described in plants. Therefore, our results can open an interesting scientific area, indicating that GABA receptors and interference with benzodiazepines are evolutionarily much older than previously anticipated. This could help to answer more questions related to the reaction of aquatic organisms to micropollutants such as psychopharmaceuticals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Background and Objectives: Malignant bone tumors represent a major problem due to their aggressiveness and low survival rate. One of the determining factors for improving vital and functional prognosis is the shortening of the time between the onset of symptoms and the moment when treatment starts. The objective of the study is to predict the malignancy of a bone tumor from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using deep learning algorithms. Materials and Methods: The cohort contained 23 patients in the study (14 women and 9 men with ages between 15 and 80). Two pretrained ResNet50 image classifiers are used to classify T1 and T2 weighted MRI scans. To predict the malignancy of a tumor, a clinical model is used. The model is a feed forward neural network whose inputs are patient clinical data and the output values of T1 and T2 classifiers. Results: For the training step, the accuracies of 93.67% for the T1 classifier and 86.67% for the T2 classifier were obtained. In validation, both classifiers obtained 95.00% accuracy. The clinical model had an accuracy of 80.84% for training phase and 80.56% for validation. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the clinical model shows that the algorithm can perform class separation. Conclusions: The proposed method is based on pretrained deep learning classifiers which do not require a manual segmentation of the MRI images. These algorithms can be used to predict the malignancy of a tumor and on the other hand can shorten the time of their diagnosis and treatment process. While the proposed method requires minimal intervention from an imagist, it needs to be tested on a larger cohort of patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha galactosidase and has a very large genotypic and phenotypic spectrum. Some patients who carry hypomorphic mutations can benefit from oral therapy with a pharmacological chaperone. The drug requires a very precise regimen because it is a reversible inhibitor of alpha-galactosidase. We looked for molecules that can potentiate this pharmacological chaperone, among drugs that have already been approved for other diseases. We tested candidate molecules in fibroblasts derived from a patient carrying a large deletion in the gene GLA, which were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing hypomorphic mutants. In our cell model, three drugs were able to potentiate the action of the pharmacological chaperone. We focused our attention on one of them, acetylsalicylic acid. We expect that acetylsalicylic acid can be used in synergy with the Fabry disease pharmacological chaperone and prolong its stabilizing effect on alpha-galactosidase.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Identifying the presence of intravenous contrast material on CT scans is an important component of data curation for medical imaging–based artificial intelligence model development and deployment. Use of intravenous contrast material is often poorly documented in imaging metadata, necessitating impractical manual annotation by clinician experts. Authors developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based deep learning platform to identify intravenous contrast enhancement on CT scans. For model development and validation, authors used six independent datasets of head and neck (HN) and chest CT scans, totaling 133 480 axial two-dimensional sections from 1979 scans, which were manually annotated by clinical experts. Five CNN models were trained first on HN scans for contrast enhancement detection. Model performances were evaluated at the patient level on a holdout set and external test set. Models were then fine-tuned on chest CT data and externally validated. This study found that Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine metadata tags for intravenous contrast material were missing or erroneous for 1496 scans (75.6%). An EfficientNetB4-based model showed the best performance, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.996 and 1.0 in HN holdout (n = 216) and external (n = 595) sets, respectively, and AUCs of 1.0 and 0.980 in the chest holdout (n = 53) and external (n = 402) sets, respectively. This automated, scan-to-prediction platform is highly accurate at CT contrast enhancement detection and may be helpful for artificial intelligence model development and clinical application.

		<description><![CDATA[Intraperitoneal metastasis is a challenging clinical scenario in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). As they are distinct from hematogenous metastasizing tumors, epithelial ovarian cancer cells primarily disseminate within the peritoneal cavity to form superficially invasive carcinomas. Unfavorable pharmacokinetics for peritoneal tumors and gut toxicity collectively lead to a narrow therapeutic window and therefore limit the opportunities for a favorable clinical outcome. New insights into tumor metastasis in the peritoneal microenvironment are keenly awaited to develop new therapeutic strategies. Epithelial ovarian cancer stem cell (OCSC) seeding is considered to be a critical component of the peritoneal spread. Using a unique and stepwise process of the OCSC differentiation model may provide insight into the intraperitoneal metastasis. The transcriptome and epigenome of OCSC differentiation were characterized by expression array and MethylCap-Seq. The TCGA, AOCS, and KM-Plotter databases were used to evaluate the association between survival outcomes and the methylation/expression levels of candidate genes in the EOC datasets. The STRING database was used to investigate the protein&amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) for candidates and their associated genes. The infiltration level of immune cells in EOC patients and the association between clinical outcome and OCSCs differentiation genes were estimated using the TIDE and TIME2.0 algorithms. We established an EOC differentiation model using OCSCs. After an integrated transcriptomics and methylomics analysis of OCSCs differentiation, we revealed that the genes associated with earlier OCSC differentiation were better able to reflect the patient&amp;rsquo;s outcome. The OCSC differentiation genes were involved in regulating metabolism shift and the suppressive immune microenvironment. High GPD1 expression with high pro-tumorigenic immune cells (M2 macrophage, and cancer associated fibroblast) had worst survival. Moreover, we developed a methylation signature, constituted by GNPDA1, GPD1, GRASP, HOXC11, and MSLN, that may be useful for prognostic prediction in EOC. Our results revealed a novel role of epigenetic plasticity OCSC differentiation and suggested metabolic and immune intervention as a new therapeutic strategy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Recurrent ovarian-cancer patients face low 5-year survival rates despite chemotherapy. A variety of guideline-recommended second-line therapies are available, but they frequently result in trial-and-error treatment. Alterations and adjustments are common in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. The drug response of 30 lesions obtained from 22 relapsed ovarian cancer patients to different chemotherapeutic and molecular agents was analyzed with the patient-derived ovarian-cancer spheroid model. The profile of druggable biomarkers was immunohistochemically assessed. The second-line combination therapy of carboplatin with gemcitabine was significantly superior to the combination of carboplatin with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) or paclitaxel (p = 0.0007). Except for treosulfan, all nonplatinum treatments tested showed a lesser effect on tumor spheroids compared to that of platinum-based therapies. Treosulfan showed the highest efficacy of all nonplatinum agents, with significant advantage over vinorelbine (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and topotecan (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), the next best agents. The comparative testing of a variety of treatment options in the ovarian-cancer spheroid model resulted in the identification of more effective regimens for 30% of patients compared to guideline-recommended therapies. Recurrent cancers obtained from different patients revealed profound interpatient heterogeneity in the expression pattern of druggable protein biomarkers. In contrast, different lesions obtained from the same patient revealed a similar drug response and biomarker expression profile. Biological heterogeneity observed in recurrent ovarian cancers might explain the strong differences in the clinical drug response of these patients. Preclinical drug testing and biomarker profiling in the ovarian-cancer spheroid model might help in optimizing treatment management for individual patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(1) Background: The frequency of cognitive impairment (CI) reported in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is highly variable, and its relationship with demographic and clinical characteristics is poorly understood. We aimed to describe the cognitive profile of NMOSD patients, and to analyse the cognitive differences according to their serostatus; furthermore, we aimed to assess the relationship between cognition, demographic and clinical characteristics, and other aspects linked to health-related quality of life (HRQoL). (2) Methods: This cross-sectional study included 41 patients (median age, 44 years; 85% women) from 13 Spanish centres. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected along with a cognitive z-score (Rao&amp;rsquo;s Battery) and HRQoL patient-centred measures, and their relationship was explored using linear regression. We used the Akaike information criterion to model which characteristics were associated with cognition. (3) Results: Fourteen patients (34%) had CI, and the most affected cognitive domain was visual memory. Cognition was similar in AQP4-IgG-positive and -negative patients. Gender, mood, fatigue, satisfaction with life, and perception of stigma were associated with cognitive performance (adjusted R2 = 0.396, p &amp;lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusions: The results highlight the presence of CI and its impact on HRQoL in NMOSD patients. Cognitive and psychological assessments may be crucial to achieve a holistic approach in patient care.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Emergency departments (EDs) had to considerably change their patient flow policies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such changes affect patient crowding, waiting time, and other qualities related to patient care and experience. Field experiments, surveys, and simulation models can generally offer insights into patient flow under pandemic conditions. This paper provides a thorough and transparent account of the development of a multi-method simulation model that emulates actual patient flow in the emergency department under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Additionally, a number of performance measures useful to practitioners are introduced. A conceptual model was extracted from the main stakeholders at the case hospital through incremental elaboration and turned into a computational model. Two agent types were mainly modeled: patient and rooms. The simulated behavior of patient flow was validated with real-world data (Smart Crowding) and was able to replicate actual behavior in terms of patient occupancy. In order to further the validity, the study recommends several phenomena to be studied and included in future simulation models such as more agents (medical doctors, nurses, beds), delays due to interactions with other departments in the hospital and treatment time changes at higher occupancies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This article moves beyond analysis methods related to a traditional relational database or network analysis and offers a novel graph network technique to yield insights from a hospital&amp;rsquo;s emergency department work model. The modeled data were saved in a Neo4j graphing database as a time-varying graph (TVG), and related metrics, including degree centrality and shortest paths, were calculated and used to obtain time-related insights from the overall system. This study demonstrated the value of using a TVG method to model patient flows during emergency department stays. It illustrated dynamic relationships among hospital and consulting units that could not be shown with traditional analyses. The TVG approach augments traditional network analysis with temporal-related outcomes including time-related patient flows, temporal congestion points details, and periodic resource constraints. The TVG approach is crucial in health analytics to understand both general factors and unique influences that define relationships between time-influenced events. The resulting insights are useful to administrators for making decisions related to resource allocation and offer promise for understanding impacts of physicians and nurses engaged in specific patient emergency department experiences. We also analyzed customer ratings and reviews to better understand overall patient satisfaction during their journey through the emergency department.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A model offering anatomic replication and haptic feedback similar to that of real bone is essential for hands-on surgical dental implant training. Patient-specific skeletal models can be produced with 3-dimensional (3D) printing, but whether these models can offer optimal haptic feedback for simulating implant surgery is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this trial was to compare the haptic feedback of different 3D-printed models for simulating dental implant surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cone beam computed tomography image of a 60-year-old man with a partially edentulous mandible was manipulated to segment the mandible and isolated from the rest of the scan. Three-dimensional models were printed with 6 different printers and materials: material jetting-based printer (MJ, acrylic-based resin); digital light processing-based printer (DLP, acrylic-based resin); fused filament fabrication-based printer (FFF1, polycarbonate filament; FFF2, polylactic acid filament); stereolithography-based printer (SLA, acrylic-based resin); and selective laser sintering-based printer (SLS, polyamide filament). Five experienced maxillofacial surgeons performed a simulated implant surgery on the models. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was established to assess the haptic feedback. The Friedman test and cumulative logit models were applied to evaluate differences among the models (α=.05). RESULTS: The median score for drilling perception and implant insertion was highest for the MJ-based model and lowest for the SLS-based model. In relation to the drill chips, a median score of&nbsp;≥3 was observed for all models. The score for corticotrabecular transition was highest for the MJ-based model and lowest for the FFF2-based model. Overall, the MJ-based model offered the highest score compared with the other models. CONCLUSIONS: The 3D-printed model with MJ technology and acrylic-based resin provided the best haptic feedback for performing implant surgery. However, none of the models were able to completely replicate the haptic perception of real bone. ispartof: J Prosthet Dent pages:S0022-3913(22)00201-3- ispartof: location:United States status: Published online]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We develop a patient-specific dynamical system model from the time series data of the cancer patient&amp;rsquo;s metabolic panel taken during the period of cancer treatment and recovery. The model consists of a pair of stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks and a fully connected neural network in each unit. It is intended to be used by physicians to trace back and look forward at the patient&amp;rsquo;s metabolic indices, to identify potential adverse events, and to make short-term predictions. When the model is used in making short-term predictions, the relative error in every index is less than 10% in the L&amp;infin; norm and less than 6.3% in the L1 norm in the validation process. Once a master model is built, the patient-specific model can be calibrated through transfer learning. As an example, we obtain patient-specific models for four more cancer patients through transfer learning, which all exhibit reduced training time and a comparable level of accuracy. This study demonstrates that this modeling approach is reliable and can deliver clinically acceptable physiological models for tracking and forecasting patients&amp;rsquo; metabolic indices.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ascending Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (ATAA) is a permanent dilatation of the aorta which is usually related to tissue degeneration, hemodynamic conditions, lifestyle, environmental and genetic factors. As the mechanical conditions can become critical in a dilated aorta, a patient-specific computational model can be very useful to assist clinical decisions in the management of ATAAs. In this article, we model the biomechanical conditions of ATAA by performing Fluid&amp;ndash;Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations in the SimVascular open-source software package. The patient-specific geometric model is reconstructed from Computed Tomography scan (CT). The numerical implementation takes into account patient-specific outlet conditions and a temporal flow variation at the model inlet. We performed a mesh convergence analysis on a new mesh reconstruction method in SimVascular and showed that it can significantly reduce the computational cost without impacting the accuracy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Purpose: (i) To examine the criterion taller-than-wide (TTW) for the sonographic assessment of thyroid nodules in areas of iodine deficiency in terms of frequency, anatomical distribution within the thyroid gland and risk of malignancy. (ii) To develop a model for nodule growth in the thyroid gland. Methods: German multicenter study consisting of two parts. In the prospective part, thyroid nodules were sonographically measured in all three dimensions, location within the thyroid gland and contact to a protrusion-like formation (horn) in the dorsal position of thyroid gland was noted. In addition, further sonographic features such as the composition, echogenity, margins and calcifications were investigated. All nodules from the prospective part were assessed for malignancy as part of clinical routine at the decision of the treating physician adhering to institutionally based algorithms. In the retrospective part, only nodules with fine needle aspiration and/or histology were included. The risk of malignancy in TTW nodules was determined by correlating them with cyotological and histological results. Results: Prospective part: out of 441 consecutively evaluated thyroid nodules, 6 were found to be malignant (1.4%, 95% CI 0.6&amp;ndash;2.7%). Among the 74 TTW nodules (17%), 1 was malignant (1%, 95% CI 0&amp;ndash;4%). TTW nodules were more often located in the dorsal half of the thyroid than non-TTW nodules (factor 2.3, p = 0.01, 95% CI 2.1&amp;ndash;2.5) and more often located in close proximity to a horn than non-TTW nodules (factor 3.0, p = 0.01, 95% CI 2.4&amp;ndash;3.8). Retrospective part: out of 1315 histologically and/or cytologically confirmed thyroid nodules, 163 TTW nodules were retrieved and retrospectively analyzed. A TTW nodule was 1.7 times more often benign when it was dorsal (95% CI 1.1&amp;ndash;2.5) and 2.5 times more often benign when it was associated with a horn (95% CI 1.2&amp;ndash;5.3). The overall probability of malignancy for TTW nodules was 38% (95% CI 30&amp;ndash;46%) in this highly preselected patient group. Conclusion: TTW nodules are common in iodine deficient areas. They are often located in the dorsal half of the thyroid gland and are frequently associated with a dorsal protrusion-like formation (horn) of the thyroid. Obviously, the shape of benign nodules follows distinct anatomical preconditions within the thyroid gland. The frequency of TTW nodules and their predominant benignity can be explained by a pole concept of goiter growth. The difference between the low malignancy risk of TTW nodules found on a prospective basis and the high risk found retrospectively may be the result of a positive preselection in the latter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<jats:p>Shared care involves collaboration between primary care, secondary and tertiary care that enables the allocation of responsibilities of care according to the treatment needs of patients over the course of a mental illness. This study aims to determine stakeholders’ perspectives on the features of an ideal shared care model and barriers to practicing shared care within addiction and mental health programs in Edmonton, Canada. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study with data collected through focus group discussions. Participants included patients, general practitioners, psychiatrists, management, and therapists working in primary and secondary addiction and mental health. Responses were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Perceived barriers to the implementation of an ideal shared care model identified by participants include fragmented communication between primary and secondary healthcare providers, patient and family physician discomfort with discussing addiction and mental health, a lack of staff capacity, confidentiality issues, and practitioner buy-in. Participants also identified enablers to include implementing shared electronic medical record systems, improving communication and collaboration, physical co-location, and increasing practitioner awareness of appropriate referrals and services. This original research provides stakeholders’ perspectives on the features of an ideal shared care model and barriers to practicing shared care within addiction and mental health programs.</jats:p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is the second most common cancer type arising from the salivary gland. The frequent occurrence of chromosome t(6;9) translocation leading to the fusion of MYB and NFIB transcription factor genes is considered a genetic hallmark of ACC. This inter-chromosomal rearrangement may encode multiple variants of functional MYB-NFIB fusion in ACC. However, the lack of an ACC model that harbors the t(6;9) translocation has limited studies on defining the potential function and implication of chimeric MYB-NFIB protein in ACC. This report aims to establish a MYB-NFIB fusion protein expressing system in ACC cells for in vitro and in vivo studies. RNA-seq data from MYB-NFIB translocation positive ACC patients&amp;rsquo; tumors and MYB-NFIB fusion transcript in ACC patient-derived xenografts (ACCX) was analyzed to identify MYB breakpoints and their frequency of occurrence. Based on the MYB breakpoint identified, variants of MYB-NFIB fusion expression system were developed in a MYB-NFIB deficient ACC cell lines. Analysis confirmed MYB-NFIB fusion protein expression in ACC cells and ACCXs. Furthermore, recombinant MYB-NFIB fusion displayed sustained protein stability and impacted transcriptional activities of interferon-associated genes set as compared to a wild type MYB. In vivo tumor formation analysis indicated the capacity of MYB-NFIB fusion cells to grow as implanted tumors, although there were no fusion-mediated growth advantages. This expression system may be useful not only in studies to determine the functional aspects of MYB-NFIB fusion but also in evaluating effective drug response in vitro and in vivo settings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Background: Political governance and technological development have transitioned the Swedish primary healthcare market from a centrally planned, community-oriented model with limited choice for patients to a quasi-market with extensive patient choice. Starting in 2007, reforms promoting patient choice in primary healthcare were gradually introduced in multiple regions in Sweden, and in 2010, all regions across the country were legally required to enable patient choice. Provision of telemedicine – in this thesis defined as healthcare consultations via video calls or text messaging where the patient and the healthcare personnel are spatially separated – emerged in primary healthcare when patient choice was further expanded in 2015. From this point, choice was no longer limited to a certain geographical region, but could extend to primary healthcare providers throughout the country. Aim: The aim of this thesis was to shed light on the consequences of expanding patient choice and introducing telemedicine in primary healthcare by empirically investigating patient behaviors in response to these changes. Methods: To approach the aim, I departed from four assumptions about patient behavior which related to four central themes in healthcare: quality, continuity, equity, and demand. The assumptions I investigated were: Quality assumption: Patients are sensitive to quality in their choice of primary healthcare provider. Continuity assumption: Lack of informational continuity leads to worse health outcomes. Equity assumption: Telemedicine consultations are used to a greater extent by individuals with lower healthcare needs. Demand assumption: Use of telemedicine consultations increases the overall consumption of primary healthcare. In all studies of the thesis, comprehensive total population registries were used to investigate patient behaviors. In the quality study, Study I, we investigated whether quality influenced choice of primary healthcare provider by exploring the trade-off between distance to chosen primary healthcare provider and subjective and objective quality measures. We investigated choice of provider in 2017 and included all residents of Region Stockholm who had been in contact with primary healthcare at least once in 2016 or 2017 in the study population (n=1.4 million). The trade-off was studied using a conditional logit analysis. In the continuity study, Study II, logistic regression was applied to investigate if patients who had had their inpatient diagnosis recorded in primary healthcare as well – a measure of informational continuity – filled prescriptions of recommended pharmacotherapies to a greater extent than patients whose diagnosis was not recorded. The study population consisted of 19,072 individuals with an inpatient diagnosis of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or acute coronary syndrome during the period 2010–2013. In the equity study, Study III, we explored the characteristics of users of telemedicine consultations by investigating the socioeconomic, demographic, and contextual determinants for having made at least one telemedicine consultation in 2018. For comparison, face-to-face physician consultations in primary healthcare were included in the study, as well as digiphysical physician consultations, i.e., telemedicine consultations offered by traditional primary healthcare providers also offering face-to-face visits, and telephone consultations by nurses. All residents of Region Stockholm who were registered with a primary healthcare provider (n=2.0 million) were included in the study population. In the demand study, Study IV, we investigated healthcare consumption following a telemedicine consultation and a face-to-face consultation, respectively. The study population included all individuals who had ≥ 1 physician consultation (telemedicine or face-to-face) during the first half of 2018. Telemedicine users were matched 1:2 to users of face-to-face visits on diagnosis and demographic and socioeconomic variables. Their healthcare consumption, in terms of physician consultations, was compared in an interrupted time series analysis. Findings: The findings of the thesis lent some support to the four assumptions about patient behavior on the primary healthcare market in transition. In the quality study, the findings suggested that quality had a small impact on choice of provider. However, other aspects – such as the care needs of the individuals registered with a primary healthcare provider – seemed much more important. In the continuity study, the findings revealed a clear positive association between recorded diagnosis and use of recommended pharmacotherapies, indicating that informational continuity is beneficial for patient health. Regarding the equity and demand studies, the findings showed that the use of telemedicine was not equally distributed in the population and that telemedicine users increased their healthcare consumption after a physician consultation more than the matched control group consisting of users of only face-to-face consultations. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the market mechanism “choice” is not sufficient to ensure quality in primary healthcare. The mechanism might be enforced by better information to patients, but quality should be ensured through other measures. Informational continuity seems beneficial for patients and should be encouraged. The measure “recorded diagnosis” does seem to have a valid role as a follow-up indicator in primary healthcare and the level of diagnosis recording could most likely be improved. Regarding telemedicine, it is important to ensure that the fast technological development does not create a digital divide in healthcare. It will grow increasingly important to ensure that those who need an alternative to a digital channel – whether it is for seeing a physician or booking an appointment – are not deprived of this. In addition, measures to promote access to the groups in the population with a particularly low level of telemedicine consumption should be considered in order to ensure that all groups have access to the health services that best suits their needs. Telemedicine and digital innovations have a lot of potential but are also associated with a risk of overuse. The research highlights the need to promptly investigate the costs and benefits of telemedicine, so that its use can be encouraged when it is most cost-efficient and limited when it is not. The methods applied in this thesis may be useful to monitor the development of the area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted cancer care to a certain degree. There is objective evidence that COVID-19 outbreaks are causing substantial emotional distress among cancer patients regardless of their disease severity. This study aims to measure the levels of psychological distress, depression, and pandemic anxiety among cancer patients in Saudi Arabia during the outbreak of COVID-19 and their impact on patients&amp;rsquo; cancer treatment plans. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among oncology patients in Saudi Arabia in November of 2020. The levels of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak were measured using the Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4), and patients were classified as depressed/distressed if the total score was 6 and above and classified as not depressed/distressed if they scored less than 6. Results: Among the sampled population, anxiety symptoms and depression were detected in 61.5% and 70.2%, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed that feeling more isolated was significant for anxiety symptoms (p = 0.005), while patients who used institutions as a source of COVID-19 information had significant depression (p = 0.010) compared to patients who accessed information from other sources. In the binary regression model, feeling more isolated than before was 3.208 times more likely to be associated with anxiety symptoms (OR = 3.208; 95% CI = 1.391&amp;ndash;7.396; p = 0.006), while those patients who had a support institution as a source of COVID-19 information were 4.2 times more likely to be associated with depression (OR = 4.200; 95% CI = 1.328&amp;ndash;13.280; p = 0.015). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the burden on cancer patients. The increased risk of anxiety symptoms and depression was clearly demonstrated in this study. Feeling isolated had a greater impact on anxiety symptoms, while obtaining COVID-19 information from a patient support institution negatively affected depression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Background: The aim of this study was to identify the increased value of integrating computed tomography (CT) radiomics analysis with the radiologists&amp;rsquo; diagnosis and clinical factors to preoperatively diagnose cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. Methods: A total of 178 PTC patients were randomly divided into a training (n = 125) and a test cohort (n = 53) with a 7:3 ratio. A total of 2553 radiomic features were extracted from noncontrast, arterial contrast-enhanced and venous contrast-enhanced CT images of each patient. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson&amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient (PCC) were used for feature selection. Logistic regression was employed to build clinical&amp;ndash;radiological, radiomics and combined models. A nomogram was developed by combining the radiomics features, CT-reported lymph node status and clinical factors. Results: The radiomics model showed a predictive performance similar to that of the clinical&amp;ndash;radiological model, with similar areas under the curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC). The combined model showed an optimal predictive performance in both the training (AUC, 0.868; ACC, 86.83%) and test cohorts (AUC, 0.878; ACC, 83.02%). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the combined model has good clinical application value. Conclusions: Embedding CT radiomics into the clinical diagnostic process improved the diagnostic accuracy. The developed nomogram provides a potential noninvasive tool for LNM evaluation in PTC patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Long non-coding RNA Homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is recognized as a participant in different processes of normal cell development. Aberrant overexpression of HOTAIR contributes to the initiation, growth, and invasiveness of ovarian cancer. Using the affinity interaction of target HOTAIR lncRNA sequences towards a screen-printed gold electrode (SPE-Au), herein we report on a novel, rapid and simple method to detect HOTAIR sequences. HOTAIR lncRNA sequences were first extracted from ovarian cancer cell lines and patient plasma samples and were magnetically captured and purified by complimentary capture probe-functionalized magnetic beads. Isolated target HOTAIR lncRNAs were directly adsorbed onto unmodified screen-printed gold electrodes (SPE-Au) for direct quantification with [Fe(CN)6]3&amp;minus;/4&amp;minus; redox couple. Our assay achieved a linear dynamic range of 100 nM and 1 pM for detecting pre-clinical model HOTAIR lncRNA samples (%RSD &amp;le; 5%, for n = 3) and was highly specific, showing clear distinction between HOTAIR lncRNA targets and non-specific miR-891 and miR-486 (100 nM) (%RSD &amp;le; 5%, for n = 3). The method was tested using ovarian cancer-specific cell lines (SKOV3 and OVCAR3) and mesothelial cell line (MeT-5A)-derived lncRNAs. The analytical performance of our method was validated using RT-qPCR. Finally, the method was tested using clinical samples from ovarian cancer patients and the resulting electrochemical responses show a clear distinction between the ovarian carcinoma and benign samples.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a heterogeneous cell population that can either suppress or stimulate immune responses. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs are associated with an adverse outcome from most cancer types, but have generally been found to be associated with a good prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the prognostic heterogeneity of Tregs in CRC by co-expression patterns and spatial analyses with diverse T cell markers, using multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis in two consecutive series of primary CRCs (total <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1720). Treg infiltration in tumors, scored as FOXP3<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> or CD4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/CD25<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/FOXP3<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (triple-positive) cells, was strongly correlated to the overall amount of CD3<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and CD8<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> T cells, and consequently associated with a favorable 5-year relapse-free survival rate among patients with stage I–III CRC who underwent complete tumor resection. However, high relative expression of the activation marker CD25 in triple-positive Tregs was independently associated with an adverse outcome in a multivariable model incorporating clinicopathological and known molecular prognostic markers (hazard ratio = 1.35, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.028). Furthermore, spatial marker analysis based on Voronoi diagrams and permutation testing of cellular neighborhoods revealed a statistically significant proximity between Tregs and CD8<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-cells in 18% of patients, and this was independently associated with a poor survival (multivariable hazard ratio = 1.36, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.017). These results show prognostic heterogeneity of different Treg populations in primary CRC, and highlight the importance of multi-marker and spatial analyses for accurate immunophenotyping of tumors in relation to patient outcome.</jats:p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<jats:p>Objective: To develop a new concept of teledentistry for the elderly through a web platform and associated mobile application in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: A new concept for attention via teledentistry of the elderly supported by the web platform/app TEGO (Acronym for Tele-platform of Geriatric and Dental Specialties in Spanish) was developed. Priority and urgent dental care for elderly patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic was provided onboard a mobile dental clinic equipped with all the necessary conventional dental care facilities as well as state-of-the-art digital technology. Dental care was carried out in five cities of Chile. For the study, 135 elderly patients were treated. The tele-dental care model includes visit-appointment and remote interconsultation with a staff of specialists. To evaluate patient satisfaction aspects, regarding the service / care provided, a user satisfaction survey was applied. Results: A total of 68 questionnaires were completed by patients. The results showed high levels of patients’ satisfaction after the priority or urgent dental care, which reached above 75% in all dimensions of the questionnaire (Access to dental care, user treatment, platform, recommendation). Conclusion: The generation of a technological eco-system for teledentistry can provide a series of important advantages in the attention of elderly patients, by optimizing the dental care coverage by different specialists who can provide attention to a population that has limited or no access to them.</jats:p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Medication safety is the most patient-centered aspect of nursing, and the medication process needs patients&amp;rsquo; active participation to effectively prevent medication errors. The aim of this study was to develop the concept of a patient&amp;ndash;nurse partnership for medication safety activities. The study design used the three-phase hybrid model for concept analysis: the theoretical phase, fieldwork phase, and final phase for integration. The results of a study define the concept of patient&amp;ndash;nurse partnership for medication safety as &amp;ldquo;a fair cooperative relationship of mutual responsibility in which patients and nurses share information and communicate with each other through mutual trust.&amp;rdquo; Seven attributes were derived: mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual sharing, mutual communication, mutual responsibility, fair relationship, and mutual cooperation. The conclusion of the study of patient&amp;ndash;nurse partnerships for medication safety was that it is necessary to ensure a balance in power between patient and nurse. This balance can be established through patient-centered nursing by implementing the active transfer of authority from nurses as professionals to patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<jats:p>Among people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the determination of clinical features associated with poor outcome is essential to identify those at high risk of deterioration. Here, we aimed to investigate clinical phenotypes of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and to examine the predictive value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in a representative patient collective of the Swiss population. We conducted a retrospective monocentriccohort study with patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 between 27 February and 31 December 2020. Data were analyzed descriptively, using the binary logistic regression model, proportional odds logistic regression model, competing risk analysis, and summary measure analysis. A total of 454 patients were included in our study. Dyspnea, elevated respiratory rate, low oxygen saturation at baseline, age, and presence of multiple comorbidities were associated with a more severe course of the disease. A high NLR at baseline was significantly associated with disease severity, unfavorable outcome, and mortality. In non-survivors, NLR further increased during hospital stay, whereas in survivors, NLR decreased. In conclusion, our data emphasize the importance of accurate history taking and clinical examination upon admission and confirm the role of baseline NLR as a surrogate marker for increased disease severity, unfavorable outcome, and mortality in patients hospitalized due to infection with SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<jats:p>Novel additive manufacturing (AM) techniques and particularly 3D printing (3DP) have achieved a decade of success in pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. Highly innovative personalized therapeutical solutions may be designed and manufactured through a layer-by-layer approach starting from a digital model realized according to the needs of a specific patient or a patient group. The combination of patient-tailored drug dose, dosage, or diagnostic form (shape and size) and drug release adjustment has the potential to ensure the optimal patient therapy. Among the different 3D printing techniques, extrusion-based technologies, such as fused filament fabrication (FFF) and semi solid extrusion (SSE), are the most investigated for their high versatility, precision, feasibility, and cheapness. This review provides an overview on different 3DP techniques to produce personalized drug delivery systems and medical devices, highlighting, for each method, the critical printing process parameters, the main starting materials, as well as advantages and limitations. Furthermore, the recent developments of fused filament fabrication and semi solid extrusion 3DP are discussed. In this regard, the current state of the art, based on a detailed literature survey of the different 3D products printed via extrusion-based techniques, envisioning future directions in the clinical applications and diffusion of such systems, is summarized.</jats:p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Introduction: Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) predominantly affect infants and young children. Patients below six months of age represent a particularly therapeutically challenging group. Toxicity to developing organ sites limits intensity of treatment. Information on prognostic factors, genetics, toxicity of treatment and long-term outcomes is sparse. Methods: Clinical, genetic, and treatment data of 100 patients (aged below 6 months at diagnosis) from 13 European countries were analyzed (2005&amp;ndash;2020). Tumors and matching blood samples were examined for SMARCB1 mutations using FISH, MLPA and Sanger sequencing. DNA methylation subgroups (ATRT-TYR, ATRT-SHH, and ATRT-MYC) were determined using 450 k / 850 k-profiling. Results: A total of 45 patients presented with ATRT, 29 with extracranial, extrarenal (eMRT) and 9 with renal rhabdoid tumors (RTK). Seventeen patients demonstrated synchronous tumors (SYN). Metastases (M+) were present in 27% (26/97) at diagnosis. A germline mutation (GLM) was detected in 55% (47/86). DNA methylation subgrouping was available in 50% (31 / 62) with ATRT or SYN; for eMRT, methylation-based subgrouping was not performed. The 5-year overall (OS) and event free survival (EFS) rates were 23.5 &amp;plusmn; 4.6% and 19 &amp;plusmn; 4.1%, respectively. Male sex (11 &amp;plusmn; 5% vs. 35.8 &amp;plusmn; 7.4%), M+ stage (6.1 &amp;plusmn; 5.4% vs. 36.2 &amp;plusmn; 7.4%), presence of SYN (7.1 &amp;plusmn; 6.9% vs. 26.6 &amp;plusmn; 5.3%) and GLM (7.7 &amp;plusmn; 4.2% vs. 45.7 &amp;plusmn; 8.6%) were significant prognostic factors for 5-year OS. Molecular subgrouping and survival analyses confirm a previously described survival advantage for ATRT-TYR. In an adjusted multivariate model, clinical factors that favorably influence the prognosis were female sex, localized stage, absence of a GLM and maintenance therapy. Conclusions: In this cohort of homogenously treated infants with MRT, significant predictors of outcome were sex, M-stage, GLM and maintenance therapy. We confirm the need to stratify which patient groups benefit from multimodal treatment, and which need novel therapeutic strategies. Biomarker-driven tailored trials may be a key option.]]></description>
